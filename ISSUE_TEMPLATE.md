This repository is moving to a new customer feedback system. See https://aka.ms/ContentUserFeedback.

As part of this transition, this channel will be closed in the near future for entering issues on the Visual Studio documentation. To report an issue with an article, use the feedback button at the top right of the article, or immediately following the article.

For information about reporting a problem with Visual Studio, see [Report a problem](docs/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md).
