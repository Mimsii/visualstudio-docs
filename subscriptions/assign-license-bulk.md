# Assign subscriptions to multiple users

The Subscriptions Admin Portal lets you add users one-at-a-time, or in large groups. To add individual users, see [Add single users](assign-license.md).

To add large groups of users, you can use the bulk add feature, or if your organization is using Microsoft Entra **and your organization has a trusted agreement**, you can use Microsoft Entra groups. This article explains the process for both options. Watch this video or read on to learn more about the bulk add feature. 

## Use Bulk add to assign subscriptions

## Follow these steps to use the Bulk add feature:

1. Sign into the Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin Portal at <https://manage.visualstudio.com>.

1. To add multiple subscribers at one time, navigate to the **Manage Subscribers** tab. Choose the **Add** tab, then choose **Bulk add** in the drop-down. 

1. Bulk add uses a Microsoft Excel template to upload subscriber information. In the Upload Multiple Subscribers dialog box, select **Download** to download the template.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Download the Excel template to upload multiple subscribers](media/download-template-upload-subscribers.png "Screenshot of the Upload multiple subscribers dialog. The link to download the template is highlighted.")
   >
   > [!NOTE]
   > Always download the latest version of this template. If you use an older version, your bulk upload can fail.

1. In the Excel spreadsheet, fill out the fields with the information for the individuals that you want to assign subscriptions to. (*Reference* is an optional field.) Save the file locally after you're done.

    > [!NOTE]
    > One of the fields in the template allows admins to enable or disable subscribers' ability to download software. Disabling downloads also disables their access to product keys.

   To help ensure a smooth upload, observe the following best practices:

    + Ensure that none of the form fields contain commas.
    + Remove spaces before and after values in form fields.
    + Make sure user's names don't contain extra spaces between two-part first or family names. For example, if a person has a two-part first name such as "Maggie May," it should be typed as "MaggieMay" because the system doesn't trim the extra space.
    + Make sure all required fields are completed. 
    + Check the **Error message** column. If any errors are listed, resolve them before attempting to upload the file. 

1. Return to the Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin portal. In the **Upload Multiple Subscribers** dialog box, select **Browse**.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Browse to your saved template to upload multiple subscribers](media/bulk-add-browse-saved-template.png "Screenshot of the Upload multiple subscribers dialog. The Browse option to locate the completed template is highlighted.")

1. Navigate to the Excel file that you saved, and then select **OK**.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Upload the Excel template to upload multiple subscribers](media/bulk-upload-subscribers.png "Screenshot of the Upload multiple subscribers dialog. The name of the completed upload template is highlighed.")

    An upload progress dialog appears.

    If the template contains errors, the upload fails. You're shown the errors so that you can correct the template and attempt the bulk upload again.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Error message if the upload of multiple subscribers fails](_img/assign-license-bulk/bulk-add-upload-failure.png "Screenshot of the Manage subscribers page showing an error message indicating the bulk upload has failed.")

   If you encounter a failure, follow these steps:
   1. Open the Excel file you created, correct the problems, and save the file.
   0. Return to the Admin Portal and dismiss the error message.
   0. Choose **Add**.
   0. Select **Bulk add**.
   0. Since you already have the Excel file saved, you don't need to download the template. Select **Browse**, locate the file you saved, and select **Open**.
   0. Select **OK**.

    When the upload is successful, you see the list of subscribers and a confirmation message.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Confirmation message if the upload of multiple subscribers succeeds](_img/assign-license-bulk/bulk-add-upload-success.png "Screenshot of the Manage subscribers page showing a message confirming the upload was successful.")

## Use Microsoft Entra groups to assign subscriptions 

Using this feature makes it easy to stay on top of your subscription assignments. Add Microsoft Entra groups in the Subscriptions Admin Portal to ensure that everyone in the group is assigned a subscription. When members leave your organization and are removed from Microsoft Entra ID, their access to subscriptions is also removed automatically for you. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The following limitations apply to the use of Microsoft Entra groups for adding subscribers:
> + **Only TRUSTED agreements are can use Microsoft Entra groups.**
> + **MPSA agreements can overallocate subscriptions but can't use Entra groups.**
> + The admin must be a member of the Microsoft Entra tenant when initially adding a group to the admin portal. After the group has been added, changes to the membership of the groups does not require admin involvement. 
> + Groups must contain at least one member. Empty groups are not supported.
> + All users must be in the top level of the group. Nested groups are not supported.
> + All members of the group must have an email address associated with their Microsoft Entra account.
> + Separate email addresses for notifications are not supported for subscriptions added using Microsoft Entra groups.

1. Sign in to the Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin Portal at [https://manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com).

2. To add multiple subscribers at one time, navigate to the **Manage subscribers** tab.

3. Choose the **Add** tab, then select **Microsoft Entra group** in the drop-down.

   > ![Choose bulk add using Microsoft Entra ID](_img/assign-license-bulk/bulk-add-entra.png "Screenshot of the Manage subscribers page. The Microsoft Entra group option on the Add menu is highlighted.")

4. A fly-out window appears in the right pane. Begin to enter the name of the Microsoft Entra group that you'd like to add into the form field. The system searches the available Microsoft Entra groups within your organization for a match. 

5. When you select the group, the field populates with the group name. You're able to view the users in that group before you add them. Next, you can choose the subscription level, download rights, and communication preferences for the group. You can add details into the reference field if you wish. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Choose your Microsoft Entra group](_img/assign-license-bulk/bulk-add-entra-details.png "Screenshot of the Add group dialog. Search results are displayed.")

6. Select **Add** and then **Confirm**. 

7. To see the added group, scroll to the bottom of your list of users. 

8. Select **View subscribers** to display the members of the group. You can view details about the subscribers in the group. However, you can't make any edits to the subscribers or the subscriptions assigned to them. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you've already assigned subscriptions individually to users who are subsequently added as part of a Microsoft Entra group, they will be added as part of the group and will no longer be listed individually. If the individual subscription is for a different subscription level, however, they will have two subscriptions. Example:  If a user has an individual Visual Studio Professional subscription, and they are a member of a group to which you assign Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions, they will have both. 
>
> If you remove a subscriber from a Microsoft Entra group that has had subscriptions assigned to it, it can take up to 24 hours for the update to be reflected in the admin portal. 

## Frequently asked questions
