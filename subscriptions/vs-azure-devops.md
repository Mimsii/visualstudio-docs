# Azure DevOps for Visual Studio subscribers

As an active Visual Studio subscriber, you can use a range of features in Azure DevOps that are included with your subscription. You're able to use these same features in each Azure DevOps organization in which you're a member, whether you created the organization or someone else added you.

## Sign in

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Azure DevOps Tile](_img/vs-azure-devops/vs-azure-devops-tile.png "Screenshot of the Azure DevOps tile.  The Get started button is highlighted.")

   
When you sign in to Azure DevOps using either the identity that you used for activating your Visual Studio subscription or your [alternate identity](vs-alternate-identity.md), we recognize you automatically.  This way you can also add the work or school account you use when logging into Visual Studio, Microsoft 365, or your corporate or school network.  You have access to Azure DevOps using both your personal account and your work or school account.

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: As a Visual Studio Enterprise subscriber, do I get more parallel jobs for TFS and Azure Pipelines?

A:  Yes. Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers get one parallel job in Team Foundation Server 2017 or later and one self-hosted parallel job in each Azure DevOps Services organization where they're a member.

### Q: Can I also use Azure DevOps Server with my subscription?  

A: Yes.  Page 24 of the Licensing Whitepaper for the [Microsoft Visual Studio Product Family and Visual Studio Subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Visual-Studio-Licensing-Whitepaper-July2023.pdf) provides guidance on the use of Azure DevOps Server in subscriptions:

"Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription, Visual Studio Professional Subscription, Visual Studio Test Professional Subscription, MSDN Platforms, and all Visual Studio 
cloud subscribers can download and deploy one instance of Azure DevOps Server. These same Visual Studio subscribers are granted an Azure DevOps Server User CAL to be used within their organization (it isn't valid for use of Azure DevOps Server acquired by a different organization)."
