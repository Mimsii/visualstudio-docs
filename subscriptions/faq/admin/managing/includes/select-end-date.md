## How can I select an end date for a subscription?

Subscriptions are always assigned using the best available end date. For example, if your agreement has orders with an end date of June 20, 2020 and another with an end date of June 20, 2021, the first subscription to be assigned from those two available in the first order will end on in 2021. If you have a trusted agreement that's overallocated, the end date is three years from the date the subscription was assigned.
