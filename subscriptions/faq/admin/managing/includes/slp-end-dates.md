## Why does my SLP agreement have an end date, and why is it sometimes different for my subscribers?

SLP and MPSA agreements don't expire, however our portal currently requires an end date when provisioning the agreement. We currently use an end date of 20+ years in the future for each order under your SLP. If you have multiple orders under your SLP agreement from different days, they have different end dates.
