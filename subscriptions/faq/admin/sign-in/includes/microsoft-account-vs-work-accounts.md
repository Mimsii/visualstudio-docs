## What is the difference between using a Microsoft Account vs Work account?

A Microsoft Account (MSA) is a personal email account owned by an individual to access Microsoft services when an organization isn't using a managed tenant for Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra ID. A work account is one owned by the organization that issues it and is used to access services on Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra tenants. For complete information about the differences between MSAs and work accounts, see ['Learn about the differences in using MSAs (Microsoft Accounts) vs. Work Accounts (Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365) and how they may affect your organization'](https://aka.ms/MSAvsAAD).
