## How do my developers activate software using product keys from their Visual Studio subscription?

Depending on what product your subscriber has downloaded it can either be activated by logging in using the email address tied to the subscription, or subscribers can activate it [by claiming a product key](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/product-keys) from the Visual Studio [Subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com).
