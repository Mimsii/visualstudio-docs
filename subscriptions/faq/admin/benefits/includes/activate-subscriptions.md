## How do my end users activate their Visual Studio subscription?

The subscription is active and can be used as soon as it has been assigned from within the [Visual Studio Administrator portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com/subscribers). The subscriber can sign into the [Visual Studio Subscribers portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/) or Visual Studio IDE right away. They'll receive a welcome email letting them know the subscription has been assigned.
