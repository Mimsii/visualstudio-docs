## Are there any geographic or service restrictions impacting this benefit?

Azure subscriptions created via the Visual Studio Subscriptions benefit may be restricted in ways paid subscriptions aren't. Certain geographies may not be available for creating VMs and Azure services, and certain service types may not be available. There may be a lower default quota than on paid subscriptions.
