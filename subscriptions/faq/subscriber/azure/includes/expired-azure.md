## What happens to my Azure resources when my subscription expires?

When your Visual Studio subscription ends, you're no longer eligible to receive Azure monthly credits.

The emails say when assets will be disabled and deleted, and [instructions on how to purchase a subscription or transfer your Azure resources to a new subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devtest/offer/troubleshoot-expired-removed-subscription).
