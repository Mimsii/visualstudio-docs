## Are there any other limitations I should be aware of?

The monthly Azure credit for Visual Studio subscribers is for development and testing only and doesn't carry a financially backed SLA. We reserve the right to suspend any instance (VM or cloud service) that runs continuously for more than 120 hours or if we determine that the instance is being used for production. We're making this capacity available to Visual Studio subscribers on a best-effort basis; there's no guarantee of capacity availability.

The monthly credit doesn't apply toward purchase of the following services:

- Support plans
- Application Insights
- Visual Studio subscriptions
- Azure DevOps
- Visual Studio App Center
- Third-party branded products
- Products sold through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)
- Products otherwise sold separately from Azure (for example, Microsoft Entra ID P2)

To purchase these services, you need to remove your [spending limit](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-spending-limit) and provide a credit card for billing.
