## Can I use my monthly Azure credits to run production applications?

Monthly Azure credits for Visual Studio subscribers are specifically for individual dev/test usage only. To run production workloads, you need to upgrade to a paid Azure subscription such as [pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) pricing.
