## Why can't I find certain benefits? 

Available benefits vary by subscription level and are subject to change. To see which benefits are included for each paid subscription level, visit [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/). You can select the subscription you're interested in, and then see which benefits are available in the various categories - Tools, Azure, Software and Downloads, Services, Training, and Support.
