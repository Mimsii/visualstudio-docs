## What is the Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise setup process? 

Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise are managed in two parts:  
- The Visual Studio subscription (Enterprise or Professional)  
- GitHub Enterprise  

When you're assigned a Visual Studio subscription with GitHub, you receive an email letting you know that your Visual Studio Subscriptions administrator has assigned a subscription to you. At that point, you're able to view available subscription benefits at <https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits>. GitHub Enterprise is included. 

GitHub administrators manage GitHub Enterprise separately from Visual Studio subscriptions. When your company has set up a GitHub Enterprise account, you receive an email from GitHub notifying you that your Visual Studio subscription has been linked. The benefit tile updates to reflect that. Setting up this account may take some time and is dependent on your company completing the setup process. After you receive the email, you can reach out to the appropriate GitHub organization administrator to request an invitation to their organization and/or repo. 

When an invitation is sent from your GitHub org administrator, you receive an email from GitHub, and the benefit tile updates again. 

After you accept the GitHub org invitation, the appearance of the benefit tile at <https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits> will change from “Pending” to “Activated” and you can now start using GitHub Enterprise.
