## How do I add alternate identities to my subscription and how does using one affect my Azure credits and Azure DevOps?

Adding an alternate account to your Visual Studio subscription allows you to access the subscription benefits, like Azure DevOps and Azure, with a different identity than that which the subscription is assigned to. In the past, this functionality was available only if your Visual Studio (VS) subscription was assigned to a Microsoft Account (MSA). We have extended this functionality for work or school accounts in Microsoft Entra ID.

Using an alternate ID doesn't provide a copy of subscription to the other account; it only provides access the two benefits with the alternate account.

For all subscriptions, you can add a 'work or school account' so you can use that account with your benefits that require a sign-in (VS IDE, Azure DevOps, and Azure).

Adding an alternate ID is easy. Connect to [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), select on 'Add alternate account', enter the email address and select 'Add'. For more information on using alternate identities, check out our [Alternate identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity) article.
