## Should I sign in using my work email or my personal email?

To access a subscription, you should sign in with the email address to which the subscription is assigned. In most cases, your work or school assigns your subscription, so you should use your work or school credentials to sign in to the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).
