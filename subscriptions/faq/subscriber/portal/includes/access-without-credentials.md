## How do I access the My Visual Studio Subscribers Portal without knowing my sign-in credentials associated with my work email?

If you're not sure what your work email or Microsoft Entra credentials are, you should reach out to your network administrator. For privacy reasons, Microsoft is unable to provide information about credentials.
