## When does my subscription expire?

Information about your subscription is available in the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). Connect to see a list of your subscriptions and to view information such as expiration dates and support information. For retail subscriptions, you can also renew your subscription from that page.

Cloud subscriptions purchased through the Visual Studio Marketplace renew automatically.  If you're using a monthly or annual cloud subscription, you don't have to worry about it expiring until you cancel it.
