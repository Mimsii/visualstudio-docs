## What software downloads are available?

The software downloads available depend on the subscriptions you have. If you have more than one subscription, the downloads for the highest level subscription are visible from within all of your subscriptions. This makes it easy to get the downloads you want without switching between subscriptions.

Check out this [list of the downloads available by subscription level](https://aka.ms/vss_products_list). For more information about downloads, see the following articles:
