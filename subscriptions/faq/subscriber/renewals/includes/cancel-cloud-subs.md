## How do I cancel monthly and annual subscriptions?
To cancel monthly and annual subscriptions purchased from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com), you need to sign in to the [Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com) and set the number of subscriptions for your agreement to zero.

Follow these steps to reduce the number of subscriptions:
1. Sign in to the [subscriptions management portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
2. If you're an admin on more than one agreement, choose the desired agreement from the drop-down list.
3. Select the **Overview** icon at the top left to display information about your subscriptions.
4. Locate the entry for the subscriptions you wish to cancel, and select **Change quantity**. You're redirected to the Visual Studio Marketplace where you can update your purchase quantity. 
5. Set the quantity to zero (0). Your subscriptions remain in place until their scheduled billing date, but won't renew when the billing date is reached.
