# Manage Visual Studio subscriptions offered through the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program 

Partners who earn a competency or who purchase the Action Pack in the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program, formerly known as Microsoft Cloud Partner Network, are eligible to use Visual Studio subscriptions. These subscriptions are licensed per user, and are only valid when assigned to a specific named user who works for the partner company.

See Visual Studio subscriptions offered to partners in the [Microsoft Cloud Partner Program](program-mcpp.md) for details.
