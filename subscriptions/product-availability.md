# Product availability for software downloads in Visual Studio subscriptions

As part of your subscriber benefits, you have access to a wide range of software downloads.
You must be signed in to your subscription to access the [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) tab.

## Product availability

In general, commercial and consumer Microsoft products that are relevant for software development projects are made available to Visual Studio subscribers. With Visual Studio subscriptions, products typically remain available for download long into the future—even after the extended product support period has ended—to enable customers to develop and test legacy applications and transition to newer platforms. There are cases where we're unable to provide certain products to subscribers, but we make every effort to minimize these occurrences.

There are several reasons why particular products might not be available to subscribers:

+ **The product is not included in your subscription level or program.** [Learn more](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) about the software and benefits available with your subscription or [download the full list](https://aka.ms/vss_products_list) of products available by subscription level. Some programs, such as [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/), provide Visual Studio subscriptions as a part of their benefits. Those subscriptions don't include all products included in purchased Visual Studio subscriptions. Subscribers to these programs should direct questions about availability of product downloads to the support teams for those programs.
+ **The product is not included in subscriptions.** Some Microsoft products aren't included in subscriptions due to special licensing terms, technical restrictions, or developer relevance. If you would like to suggest adding a product to the subscription, send email to your Visual Studio [Customer Service Center](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/support/).
+ **The product is publicly available.** Some tools, SDKs, DDKs, and service packs are publicly available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download). Some such products might not be published to Downloads.
+ **The product has not yet released.**  Many prerelease (beta) versions and release candidates are available from Downloads. However, not all betas can be included; for instance, some betas require special registration or eligibility. 
+ **The product is not available in your country/region.** Some Microsoft products aren't available due to regional restrictions.
+ **Redundant software.** Office suites and standalone Office products might be available as either the Office suite or the standalone product, but not both for a given year. For example, if you search for PowerPoint 2010, you won't find any results. Instead, you can search for Office 2010, the suite that includes PowerPoint 2010, and download it. While a search for Office 2024 on the other hand, won't yield any results. You can, however, search for individual apps such as Access 2024, or Word 2024 and follow the process to install the software.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have multiple subscriptions associated with the same email address, the software titles available to you are determined by the **highest** level subscription you have. For example, if you have a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription and a Visual Studio Test Professional subscription, you'll have access to the software titles included with the Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, regardless of which subscription is currently in use in the subscriptions portal.

## What do I get?

The number and type of downloads depends on your subscription level and program memberships. Subscribers with Visual Studio Enterprise standard subscriptions, for example, might have different downloads available to them than subscribers who obtain their subscriptions through a Microsoft Partner Network or BizSpark program subscription. To learn more about what downloads are available for each subscription level, download the list of [Products By Benefit Level](https://aka.ms/vss_products_list).

> [!NOTE]
> As of October 2024, access to Office products is still available to subscribers; however, the link in the downloads page in the subscriptions portal will redirect subscribers to office.setup and require subscribers to sign in with their MSA.
