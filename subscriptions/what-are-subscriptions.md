## How can I purchase a subscription? 
Subscriptions are available through several channels.  
+ Volume licensing. For larger organizations would need multiple subscriptions, volume licensing provides a cost-effective way to purchase what they need. Volume license purchases frequently use multi-year agreements. Learn more about [licensing programs.](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/licensing-programs/licensing-programs?rtc=1)
+ Retail. Individuals who are looking for a subscription for their own use can purchase subscriptions through the [Microsoft Store.](https://www.microsoft.com/store) 
+ Monthly subscriptions. Sometimes called "cloud subscriptions," monthly subscriptions are billed each month and provide billing flexibility. They're a great option for developers who just need to use the IDE for a short time, and don’t need the other benefits. Monthly subscriptions can be purchased on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) or through a [Cloud Solution Provider.](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partner-dir)
