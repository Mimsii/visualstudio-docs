## Why does my agreement still show an old end date after renewal?
Depending on how your renewal was processed, you might still have the same agreement number, or you might be issued a new one. If your agreement is still reflecting an old end date, then select the agreement drop-down menu to see if there's a new agreement available. Select that agreement number to see your available subscriptions and start managing. 

If you don't see a new agreement, reach out to your super admin and verify you have permissions to the new agreement number. After you're to the new agreement, you have access to manage subscriptions again.
