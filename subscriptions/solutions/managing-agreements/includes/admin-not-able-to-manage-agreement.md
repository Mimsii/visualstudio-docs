## I'm a super admin or admin, but I’m not able to manage my agreement

After you sign into the admin portal, you can assign, edit, and remove users on all agreements you have permission to manage. If you have multiple agreements, you see an agreement dropdown menu above the assigned subscriptions panel, allowing you to move between them. 

You can only edit active agreements. When an agreement expires, even if the subscriptions are still assigned, you can no longer make changes. You can, however, view the agreements and export the list of subscribers. If you need help with moving your subscribers to a new agreement, contact support by using the "Online request" button on this page.
