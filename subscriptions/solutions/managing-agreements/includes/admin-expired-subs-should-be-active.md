## Why are my organization’s subscriptions showing as expired when they should be active?

When you are in the admin portal, you can see the agreement "End date" above the subscriber grid. You can see the "Expires" date on the row for each subscriber. If you believe they should match, reach out to the primary contact (who is also a super admin) or your reseller and verify that they should have the same date. If there are any discrepancies in the contract/agreement, submit a request to your reseller to make the necessary changes. 

If there are no errors on the contract/agreement, contact support by submitting an online request using the form on this page. You need to have the following information available:
+ Agreement number
+ The expiration date you're seeing and the correct date
+ A screenshot of the discrepancy and your contract showing the correct end dates
