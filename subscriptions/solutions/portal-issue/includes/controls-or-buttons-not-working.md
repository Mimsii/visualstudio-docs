## We're sorry to hear that you're experiencing an issue with controls or buttons while using the portal. 

If the portal controls or buttons aren't working, you see a "page can't be displayed" or blank page error, the page isn't loading or is timing out, or other portal functionality issue, try: 

+ Clearing your browser cache and signing into the subscriptions portal again. 
+ Opening the portal in a different browser.
+ Opening the portal in an Incognito or InPrivate window.
+ Refreshing the page. 

If none of these simple solutions solve the issue, contact Visual Studio subscriptions support by selecting the "Online request" on this page.
