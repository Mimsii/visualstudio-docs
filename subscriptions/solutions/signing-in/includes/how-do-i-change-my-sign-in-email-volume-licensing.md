## How to change the sign-in email for a Visual Studio subscription
Each subscription type is managed in a different way. Visual Studio Subscriptions support may need to assist you with some types.  Your company can manage other types. To check which subscription type you own, go to the [Subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), select the “support information” link and compare the subscription channel with the below listing:

+ Retail – Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using the "Online request" link on this page
+ MCT - Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using the "Online request" link on this page
+ Volume Licensing – Contact your admin by using the “contact my admin” button at the top of the portal
+ Cloud – Contact the admin who purchased the subscriptions through Azure
+ PartnerCenter – Contact your company admin
+ Free – Anyone can join the Dev Essentials program.  To change your sign-in email, leave the program and join with your new email. 

If your subscription type is different, reach out to the party that provided you with the subscription.
