## How to change the sign-in email for a Visual Studio subscription
Each subscription type is managed in a different way.  Visual Studio subscriptions support must assist you with making changes to some of them. Your company can manage other types. To check which subscription type you own, go to the [Subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), select “support information” link and compare the subscription channel with the below listing:

+ Retail – Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using the "Online request" link on this page
+ MCT - Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using the "Online request" link on this page
+ Volume Licensing – contact your admin by using the “contact my admin” button at the top of the portal
+ Cloud – contact the admin who purchased the subscriptions through Azure
+ PartnerCenter – Contact your company admin
+ Free – anyone can join the Dev Essentials program, there's no need to transfer

If your subscription type is different, you need to reach out to the party that provided you with the subscription.
