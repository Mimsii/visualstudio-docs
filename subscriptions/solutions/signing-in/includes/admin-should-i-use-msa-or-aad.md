## Should I use Microsoft Account (MSA) or Microsoft Entra ID?

An MSA is an email account owned by a subscriber to access Microsoft services. If they leave your company, they can still access services that are connected to that identity. Until access is manually removed in the admin portal, they can continue using an assigned Visual Studio subscription or manage agreements if they're an admin.

Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based tenant managed by your organization. A Microsoft Entra account can be used to control access to Microsoft services. When a subscriber leaves the company and their account is deactivated, they can no longer sign in with this email address.

We recommend using Microsoft Entra ID since the admin portal can automatically manage unauthorized access. When you deactivate a person's account in Microsoft Entra ID, access to a subscription or the admin portal is also blocked.
