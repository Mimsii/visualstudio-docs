## What are the subscription licensing terms and conditions? 

All Visual Studio subscriptions are licensed on a per-user basis. Each licensed user can install and use the software on any number of devices to design, develop, test, and demonstrate their applications. Visual Studio subscriptions also allow the licensed user to evaluate the software and to simulate customer environments to diagnose issues related to your applications. Every person who uses the software in this way must also have a license. 

For more details, [view the Microsoft Visual Studio licensing whitepaper](https://aka.ms/VSLicensingPaper). 

Subscribers can view subscriptions available to them by checking the drop-down on [the benefits page in the subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). 

[Read more about the benefits](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/) or [compare pricing and features](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) included in Visual Studio subscriptions.
