## How to find the status of my renewal or purchase?

Check the status of your subscriptions and their end dates on the Subscriptions tab in the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). Here you can view the subscription level, subscription ID, and the valid through date. After a subscription has been successfully activated or renewed, you can see it updated on this page. 

For monthly Visual Studio subscriptions, you may not see the end date on the subscription portal. In order to view dates for this type of subscription, subscribers should reach out to the admin who can view those dates in the [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com/subscribers).

To check your purchase of a retail Visual Studio subscription (new or renewal), you can do so in the [order history under your Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders).

To renew a retail Visual Studio subscription, you must purchase a subscription renewal in Microsoft Store before the expiration of your current subscription and activate it on the [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/Subscriptions).
