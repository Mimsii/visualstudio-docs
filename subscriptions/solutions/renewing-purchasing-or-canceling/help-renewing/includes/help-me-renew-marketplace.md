## Renewing or changing quantity of subscriptions through Visual Studio Marketplace 

As long as your payment method is still valid, monthly Visual Studio subscriptions through Marketplace are automatically renewed. Read more about [Visual Studio Subscriptions Azure billing](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vscloud-billing-faq). 

If you don't wish to renew a monthly subscription, reduce your number of paid users in [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). The new monthly billing amount and reduced users will take effect on the first of the next month. 

[Learn more about how to reduce the number of subscriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vscloud-overview#manage-subscriptions) through the [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
