## How do I renew subscriptions?

The way you renew subscriptions depends on how they were originally purchased. 
+ Monthly or annual subscriptions purchased through Visual Studio Marketplace renew automatically until you cancel them, so no action is needed. 
+ Subscriptions purchased through a Volume Licensing agreement are handled through your organizationâ€™s primary contact and your reseller. These agreements are typically renewed for 1-3 year periods. Sometimes a super admin is also the primary contact and would likely know the status of the renewal.
