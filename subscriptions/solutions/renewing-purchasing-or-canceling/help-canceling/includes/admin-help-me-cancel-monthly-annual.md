## How do I cancel monthly or annual subscriptions?

To cancel subscriptions purchased at marketplace.visualstudio.com using an Azure subscription, you need to set the number of subscriptions for your agreement to zero (0). Follow these steps to reduce the number of subscriptions: 

1. Ensure that you've selected the appropriate agreement from the drop-down list, if you have multiple agreements
2. Select “Overview” at the top left
3. Find the subscription level you wish to cancel and select “Change quantity”. You're taken to the Visual Studio Marketplace where can update your purchase quantity
4. Set the quantity to zero (0). Your subscriptions remain in place until their scheduled billing date, but don't renew when the billing date is reached.
