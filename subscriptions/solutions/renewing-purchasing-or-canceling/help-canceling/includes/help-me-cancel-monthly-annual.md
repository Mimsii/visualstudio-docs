## Canceling monthly and annual subscriptions

If your company purchased the subscriptions, contact your admin or purchaser.

To cancel subscriptions, you purchased yourself from marketplace.visualstudio.com (using an Azure subscription), you need to set the number of subscriptions for your agreement to zero (0). Follow these steps to reduce the number of subscriptions:

1. Sign in to the [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com/subscribers)
2. If you have multiple agreements, ensure that you've selected the appropriate agreement from the drop-down list
3. Select “Overview” at the top left
4. Find the subscription level you wish to cancel and select “Change quantity.” You're taken to the Visual Studio Marketplace where can update your purchase quantity
5. Set the quantity to zero (0). Your subscriptions remain in place until their scheduled billing date, but don't renew when the billing date is reached.
