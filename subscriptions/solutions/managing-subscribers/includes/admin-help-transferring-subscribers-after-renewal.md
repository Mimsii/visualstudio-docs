## My agreement was renewed, but the subscribers didn’t transfer over from the old agreement

When your organization renews an agreement, your reseller should check the option to have the subscriptions be automatically transferred. Follow up with your reseller to confirm that it was initiated. It can take 48-72 hours to complete after the request was submitted. 

Note: If the automatic transfer option wasn’t selected during the renewal process, it can’t be added after the agreement was signed.

If the request wasn't submitted, you can [bulk upload](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/assign-license-bulk) the users to the new agreement. From the admin portal, you can select **bulk upload** from the **Added** dropdown. An Excel form is provided for you to enter the required information so the users can be assigned. Or, if your organization is using Microsoft Entra ID you can add [Microsoft Entra groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/assign-license-bulk#use-azure-entra-id-groups-to-assign-subscriptions) to streamline the process of adding users.
