## Other software usage and features

Visual Studio subscriptions support provides assistance with sales, subscriptions, accounts, benefit activation, and billing for Visual Studio subscriptions. Should you need assistance with using software that you already downloaded and activated, you need to reach out to the respective product support team.

+ [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows)
+ Other products: [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/)

## Technical support
If you need assistance with break-fix issues, you can also use technical support tickets that are a part of most Visual Studio Subscriptions. To activate your support contract and submit tickets:
1. Visit the [Subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits), scroll down to the Support benefits section, and on the Technical Support tile select Chat to activate.
2. You join a chat session with a representative who can create your Contract ID and Access ID and provide those numbers to you via email so you have them for your records.
3. To complete the process, you need to provide the representative with:
    + Your country/region
    + Company name
    + Your full name
    + The email address you use to sign in to your subscription
    + The Subscription ID, which can be found on the Subscriptions tab.
4. After the process is completed, you'll receive an email containing your Contract ID and Access ID you'll use when creating a support incident. It provides instructions for submitting support incidents using your new Access ID and Contract ID.
