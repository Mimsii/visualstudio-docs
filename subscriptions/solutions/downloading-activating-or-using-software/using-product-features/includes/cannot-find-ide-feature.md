## What if you can't find the IDE feature you want to use? 

The specific IDE version and features available to you depend on the level of your subscription. Visual Studio appears as a tile in the tools category on the benefits page of the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). 

## Compare supported Visual Studio features 

After noting which version of Visual Studio is included with your subscription, [compare the supported features](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/) to see if the feature is available in the IDE you're using. If you’re using a version of the IDE that doesn't include a feature, you need to download the correct IDE. 

## Upgrade your subscription level  

If the feature is specific to another subscription level, you need to change your subscription level. 

If your Visual Studio subscription is provided to you by your work or school, chances are it was assigned to you by a subscriptions admin. Reach out to your organization’s admin using the "contact my admin" button in the right corner of the navigation in the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). 

If you purchased your subscription, or don't have an admin, you need to purchase a new subscription at the level you require. 

## How to contact your admin 

Given the size and complexity of many organizations, you might not be aware of who your admin is, but there's a feature in the subscriptions portal to assist you with contacting your admin. 

1. Sign in to the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). 
1. Select the Contact my Admin button at the top right. 
1. Enter the message for your admin. 
1. If you'd like to receive a copy of the message sent to your admin, select the Send me a copy checkbox. Finally, select **Send**.
