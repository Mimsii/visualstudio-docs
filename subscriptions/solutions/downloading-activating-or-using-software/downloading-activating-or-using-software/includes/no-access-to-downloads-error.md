## "You don't have access to downloads" error on downloads page
If you see this error when you visit the downloads page, your administrator disabled access to downloads for your subscription. For more details, please contact your administrator.

Alternatively, if downloads are disabled and you have a free Dev Essentials subscription, only products available through Dev Essentials are visible in the portal, despite having a paid subscription.

Should that happen, you should reach out to the administrator that assigned the subscription to you:
1. For monthly or annual subscriptions purchased through Azure, reach out to the owner of the account that was used for purchase
2. For Volume Licensing subscriptions assigned by your company, select the “contact my admin” at the top of the [Subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions)

If you have more questions, open a case with Visual Studio Subscriptions support by clicking on the "Online request" link on this page.
