## I'm unable to download or activate software (excluding Visual Studio family)


The software downloads available to you depends on the Visual Studio subscription you're using. You can find downloads and product keys a few ways. 

## Download a list of available software 

You can [download an extensive list](https://aka.ms/vss_products_list) of available software titles for all subscription types. To check what types are assigned to you, view your subscriptions in the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). 

## How to find software downloads 
1. Sign into the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). 
1. Go to the [featured downloads page](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads/featured). 
1. This page shows a list of popular downloads or allows you to search a specific product. Note: If you have more than one subscription associated with the same email, you see the downloads included with the highest-level subscription, regardless of which subscription you're viewing. 
4. Select the “Get key” link to see all keys that are available for the product you want to download. Then select “Claim key” to claim a product key if the download requires a key to get started. Make sure that both software and product key are retrieved from the subscriptions portal.

## Product keys page 

You can also visit the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page where all keys are available in aggregate. You can edit the notes column for identifying when and why you claimed the key.
