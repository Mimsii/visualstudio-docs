## What happens to Azure resources when a Visual Studio subscription expires or is removed?

If your Visual Studio subscription expires or is removed, all the subscription benefits, including the monthly Azure dev/test individual credit are no longer available. To continue using Azure with a monthly credit, you need to take one of these actions:

+ Renew the subscription
+ Purchase a new subscription
+ Contact your Visual Studio Subscriptions admin to ask for a new subscription

Read the [Maintain a Visual Studio subscription for Azure credit access](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/azure-access) article for more details.

To save your Azure resources, you must transfer your resources to a different Azure subscription that includes the Azure dev/test individual credit or convert to pay-as-you-go.

## Transferring Azure resources
You must transfer your resources to another Azure subscription before your current Azure subscription is disabled and deleted. If your subscription is deleted, you lose access to your data at the time specified in the email notification. If the subscription is disabled, you can reenable it as a pay-as-you-go subscription by following [these steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/switch-azure-offer).

## Convert your Azure subscription to pay-as-you-go

If you no longer need a Visual Studio subscription or credit but you want to continue using your Azure resources, convert your Azure subscription to pay-as-you-go pricing by [removing your spending limit](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit#remove-the-spending-limit-in-azure-portal).
