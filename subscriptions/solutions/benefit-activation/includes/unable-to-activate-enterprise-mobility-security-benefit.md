## I'm unable to activate my Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription

Starting in September 2019, a Microsoft 365 E5 offer replaced the Office 365 E3 developer subscription. You can now activate the new benefit by following below instructions.

## Activate Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription  

1. Sign in to [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). 
1. Locate the Microsoft 365 benefit tile in the "Tools" category, and select Activate. 
1. Follow the prompts to set up your Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription. 

Read the [full activation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-m365).

Should you encounter any issues with activation through Visual Studio Subscriptions, contact Visual Studio Subscriptions support by clicking on the "Online request" button at the bottom of this page. Make sure to include the error message and any IDs that come with to allow the team to assist you more quickly.

If you activate the offer through another source, refer to the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq).

## Migrate from Office 365 E3 to Microsoft 365 E5 

If you have an old Office 365 E3 developer sandbox subscription activated through a Visual Studio subscription, you can migrate to Microsoft 365 E5. If you would like to migrate to a new Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription, you need to delete your current subscription and replace it.

To get your new Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription, go to your dashboard and take the following steps: 
1. On your subscription tile, select Delete subscription. 
1. Confirm that you want to delete your subscription by typing the name of your domain in the dialog box. 
1. The setup process for your new Microsoft 365 E5 subscription starts automatically. 

After you delete your Office 365 E3 subscription and create a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription, your Office 365 E3 tenant is available for 60 days.  Be sure to migrate your data before that 60-day period expires.
