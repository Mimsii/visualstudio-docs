## I'm unable to see my Azure monthly credit in the Azure portal

There are multiple reasons you might not be able to see the Azure monthly credit. You might be using the wrong email to sign in, you might be signed in with the correct email but in the wrong directory, or you might still need to activate your monthly credit benefit. 

## Azure subscription account 

When you activate your monthly credit, we link the email that you used during activation with your Visual Studio subscription. 

You can also associate an [alternate account](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity) with your Visual Studio subscription. This association allows you to access the subscription benefits, like Azure DevOps and Azure, with a different identity than that which the subscription is assigned to. 

Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the email you set up the account with. For example, if you activated your monthly credit with your alternate account, you must always sign into your Azure subscription with that email. 

## Azure directories
 
You can have multiple directories as part of your Azure subscription. Make sure you're using the directory you set up the Azure subscription. You can view and switch directories by clicking on the account icon in the top-right corner in the Azure portal. 

Should you still be unable to find the Azure subscription you activated as a benefit after checking these things, we recommend you to contact [Azure subscriptions support](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).
