## Subscriptions renewal and the Pluralsight benefit
The Pluralsight benefit in selected Visual Studio subscriptions renews when your subscription renews. For example, if you have an annual subscription that you renew each year, the benefit is available to you each year when you renew. If you have a multi-year subscription, the Pluralsight benefit is available to you once during the term of the subscription. If you renew a multi-year subscription, the benefit is available again following the renewal. 

To find your renewal date, visit <https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions> and select *Support Information* and locate the "Valid through:" date.
