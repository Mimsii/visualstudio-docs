## How to activate the monthly Azure Dev/Test individual credit benefit

1. Sign in to the [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).
1. Locate the Azure tile for the monthly credit on the Benefits page, and select the Activate link at the bottom of the benefit tile. If you can’t locate the Azure monthly credit tile, use the [benefits comparison page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/#azure?cat=visual-studio-enterprise-subscription) to verify that your subscription includes a monthly credit. 
1. If you don't have an existing Azure subscription, you're asked to fill in the required personal information to create one. 
1. Accept the subscriptions agreement and you’re ready to go. In the future, you can access your Azure subscription at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). 

Read the [full activation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devtest/offer/quickstart-individual-credit#sign-in-through-visual-studio-myvisualstudiocombenefits).

## Geographic restrictions might apply 

Azure subscriptions created through the Visual Studio Subscriptions benefit might have restrictions that aren’t imposed on paid subscriptions. Certain geographies might not be available for creating VMs and Azure services, and certain service types might be available. There might be a lower default quota than on paid subscriptions. 

## Azure credit benefit activation errors

If you receive the error "You can't activate this Visual Studio benefit more than once" when trying to activate the monthly Azure credit benefit in a new subscription, contact Visual Studio Subscriptions support. Select the "Online request" button at the bottom of this solution. 

If your subscription has been assigned for a while, here are a few things to check first:
+ Confirm you didn't already activate this benefit already by checking the Azure monthly credit tile on the [Benefits page](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) of the subscriptions portal. 
+ You can have multiple directories as part of your Azure subscription. Make sure you're using the directory you set up the Azure subscription. You can view and switch directories by clicking on the account icon in the top-right corner in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
+ You can also associate an [alternate account](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity) with your Visual Studio subscription. if you activated your monthly credit with your alternate account, you must always sign into your Azure subscription with that email. 

## More information about Azure credits

There's no cost to use your monthly Azure credit and no credit card is required. When monthly allotment of credits runs out, your Azure resources will be shut off until the credit resets the next month. To avoid running out, you can remove the spending limit and add a payment method. Any credits beyond your monthly allotment are charged to your payment method.
