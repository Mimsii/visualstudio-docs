## Activating benefits with an alternate account
The email associated with your Visual Studio subscription is the only sign-in option for that subscription. However, should you want to use another identity to access the Visual Studio IDE, activate your monthly Azure credit benefit, or access Azure DevOps, you can add an alternate account to the subscription.
