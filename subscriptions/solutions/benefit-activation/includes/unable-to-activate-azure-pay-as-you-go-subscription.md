## I'm unable to activate my Azure Dev/Test pay-as-you-go subscription

As a Visual Studio subscriber, you receive exclusive discounted hourly rates for dev/test and cloud use rights for your subscription software on Azure. 

## Set up a subscription

1. Sign in to the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) and select the Activate link at the bottom of the Azure Dev/Test pay-as-you-go benefit tile.
1. On the Microsoft Azure sign-up page, either set up the pay-as-you-go Dev/Test offer (PAYG), or upgrade to the Visual Studio Enterprise offer. Select Continue with the current offer (pay-as-you-go Dev/Test) if you don’t wish to upgrade. 
1. Add a payment method, accept the subscription agreement, and you’re ready to go. In the future, you can access your Azure subscription at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).
