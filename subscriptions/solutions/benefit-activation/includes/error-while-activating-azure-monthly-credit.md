## I'm getting an error while trying to activate my Azure monthly credit

You can only have one monthly Azure dev/test individual credit benefit per Azure subscription associated with your Visual Studio subscription. You might be seeing an error if you previously activated the monthly Azure credit. If you're unsure if you activated the credit, log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to verify.

If you receive the error "You can't activate this Visual Studio benefit more than once" when trying to activate the monthly Azure credit benefit in a new subscription, contact Visual Studio Subscriptions support. Select the "Online request" button at the bottom of this solution.

## Verify your email

When you activate your monthly credit, we link the email that you used during activation with your Visual Studio subscription. 

You might have associated an [alternate account](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity) with your Visual Studio subscription. Adding an alternate account to your Visual Studio subscription allows you to access some subscription benefits with a different identity than the one your subscription is assigned to. 

You need to sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the email you set up the account with. For example, if you activated your monthly credit with your alternate account, you must always sign into your Azure subscription with that email. You can check if you added an alternate account at the bottom of the [subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) in the portal.
