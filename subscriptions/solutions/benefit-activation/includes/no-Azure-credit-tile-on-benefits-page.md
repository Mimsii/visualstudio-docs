## Why don't I see an Azure credit benefit tile on my benefits page?
Certain Visual Studio subscriptions that come as a benefit of other programs and Visual Studio monthly subscriptions don't include the Azure credit benefit. If you don't see the Azure credit tile on the [benefits tab](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) in the subscriptions portal, check if you're [eligible for the benefit](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-azure-eligibility).

If you're eligible, make sure that your Visual Studio Subscription is active on the [Subscriptions tab](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).

If you want to check which subscription type includes the benefits you need in your day to day work, go to the [benefit comparison page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/#benefits).

Should you be eligible and require further assistance, create a case with Visual Studio Subscriptions support by clicking the "Online request" link on this page.
