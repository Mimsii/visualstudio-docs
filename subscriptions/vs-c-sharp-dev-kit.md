# C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code

The [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) is a new Visual Studio Code extension that brings an improved editor-first C# development experience to Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The C# Dev Kit is designed to enhance your C# productivity when youâ€™re working in Visual Studio Code. It works together with the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp), which is updated to be powered by a new fully open-source Language Server Protocol (LSP) host, creating a performant, extensible, and flexible tooling environment that easily integrates new experiences into C# for VS Code. 

## What is C# Dev Kit?

C# Dev Kit borrows some familiar concepts from Visual Studio to bring a more productive and reliable C# experience to VS Code. This approach ensures a great experience whether you're quickly editing a C# file, learning C#, or debugging a backend API. The C# Dev Kit consists of a set of VS Code extensions that work together to provide a rich C# editing experience, AI-powered development, solution management, and integrated testing. As shown in the following graphic, C# Dev Kit consists of:

+ The [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp), which provides base language services support and continues to be maintained independent of this effort.
+ [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit), which builds from the foundations of Visual Studio to provide solution management, templates, and test discovery/debugging.
+ The [IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscodeintellicode-csharp) (optional), which brings AI-powered development to the editor.
