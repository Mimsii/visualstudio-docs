# Expired subscriptions

When a userâ€™s subscription expires, a red bar appears next to their name in the list of subscribers. For those subscribers to continue using their Visual Studio subscription benefits, you need to renew their licenses.

## Renew subscriptions

1. Contact your Volume Licensing reseller or your Microsoft seller.
2. Provide them with your Agreement Number and Purchase Account Number. 

Your reseller or Microsoft seller guides you through the process of renewing or purchasing more subscriptions. After the order is placed or the contract is renewed, the new subscriptions are available to [assign to subscribers](assign-license.md).
