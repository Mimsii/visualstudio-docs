* Troubleshoot, inspect, and explore code using a debugger that's tuned for Unity projects.
* Discover and write Unity scripts quickly with Unity-specific IntelliSense code-completion.
* Learn more about the code your writing by quickly accessing Unity documentation.
* Write better code with refactoring options that follow best practices for Unity scripts.
* Identify how the Unity engine is calling your code with CodeLens hints for message functions and asset usages.
* Much, [much more](#features).

### High-performance debugger
Visual Studio Tools for Unity supports the robust [debugging](using-visual-studio-tools-for-unity.md#unity-debugging) features that you expect from Visual Studio:

* Set breakpoints, including conditional breakpoints.
* Evaluate complex expressions in the Watch window.
* Inspect and modify the value of variables and arguments.
* Drill down into complex objects and data structures.

### Quick fixes and refactoring suggestions
Write better code that captures the best practices with Visual Studio's deep understanding of Unity projects.

:::zone pivot="windows"
### CodeLens hints
Identify where code is called from using CodeLens hints that show implicit calls from Unity assets. Select the hint to see a list of implicit calls. Selecting a specific call will navigate directly to the object in the Unity Editor.

Quickly distinguish your code from Unity methods with hints for every Unity Event Function.
