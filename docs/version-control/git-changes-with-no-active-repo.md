# Git Changes window with no active repo set

If you issue a Git instruction in Visual Studio, such as trying to commit a change when there's no active repo set, you see the Git Changes window. From this window, you may choose to:

- [Create Git repository](git-create-repository.md), if you don't have an existing Git repo.
- [Clone repository](git-clone-repository.md), if you have a Git repo hosted on a Git provider like GitHub.

If you're new to Git in Visual Studio, see [How Visual Studio makes version control easy with Git](git-with-visual-studio.md) or the [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) website.
