## Copilot Free usage limits in Visual Studio

Copilot Free provides a limited number of code completions and chat responses for free per month. Changes in Copilot functionality may indicate you've reached your monthly usage limit.
You can check the current status of your Copilot Free account on the [GitHub account settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

When you hit the usage limits, your Copilot experience in Visual Studio may be impacted as follows:

    :::column span="1"::: 
       **Usage limit for Completions is reached**
    :::column-end::: 
    :::column span="2"::: 
       User receives IntelliCode suggestions instead of Copilot completions. The Copilot badge stays green, indicating **active** status. 
    :::column-end:::

:::row::: 
    :::column span="1"::: 
       **Usage limit for Chat is reached**
