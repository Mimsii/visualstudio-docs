# Start Command

Begins debugging the startup project.

## Syntax

```cmd
Debug.Start [address]
```

## Arguments
`address`

Optional. The address at which the program suspends execution, similar to a breakpoint in source code. This argument is only valid in debug mode.

## Remarks
The **Start** command, when executed, performs a RunToCursor operation to the specified address.

## Example
This example starts the debugger and ignores any exceptions that occur.

```cmd
>Debug.Start
```
