# Manage word wrap in the editor

You can set and clear the **Word wrap** option. When this option is set, the portion of a long line that extends beyond the current width of the Code Editor window is displayed on the next line. When this option is cleared, you can scroll to the right to see the ends of long lines. You might turn this option off to facilitate the use of line numbering.

## To set word wrap preferences

1. On the Visual Studio menu bar, select **Tools** > **Options**.

1. Select **Text Editor** > **All Languages** > **General** to set this option globally.

   — or —

   Select **Text Editor**, select the folder that matches the programming language that you're using. Then select the **General** folder. For example, select **Text Editor** > **C#** > **General**.

1. Under **Settings**, select or clear the **Word wrap** option.

   When you select the **Word wrap** option, the **Show visual glyphs for word wrap** option is enabled.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Show visual glyphs for Word Wrap** option displays a return-arrow indicator where a long line wraps onto a second line. These reminder arrows are not added to your code. They are for display purposes only.

## Known issues

* [Unexpected and sporadic indents](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Unexpected-and-sporadic-indents-when-usi/10635809)
