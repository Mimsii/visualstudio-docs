# /Build (devenv.exe)

Builds a solution or project using a specified solution configuration file.

## Syntax

```shell
devenv SolutionName /Build [SolnConfigName [/Project ProjName [/ProjectConfig ProjConfigName]] [/Out OutputFilename]]
```

## Arguments

- *SolutionName*

  Required. The path and name of the solution file, relative to the solution's directory.

- *SolnConfigName*

  Optional. The name of the solution configuration (such as `Debug` or `Release`) to be used to build the solution named in *SolutionName*. If multiple solution platforms are available, you must also specify the platform (for example, `Debug|Win32`). If this argument is unspecified or an empty string (`""`), the tool uses the solution's active configuration.

- `/Project` *ProjName*

  Optional. The path and name of a project file within the solution. You can enter a relative path from the *SolutionName* folder to the project file, or the project's display name, or the full path and name of the project file.

- `/ProjectConfig` *ProjConfigName*

  Optional. The name of a project build configuration (such as `Debug` or `Release`) to be used when building the named project. If more than one solution platform is available, you must also specify the platform (for example, `Debug|Win32`). If this switch is specified, it overrides the *SolnConfigName* argument.

- `/Out` *OutputFilename*

  Optional. The name of a file that you want to send the tool's output to. If the file already exists, the tool appends the output to the end of the file.

## Remarks

- The `/Build` switch performs the same function as the **Build Solution** menu command within the integrated development environment (IDE).

- Enclose strings that include spaces in double quotes.

- Summary information for builds, including errors, can be displayed in the command window, or in any log file specified with the `/Out` switch.

- The `/Build` switch only builds projects that have changed since the last build. To build all projects in a solution, use [/rebuild](../../ide/reference/rebuild-devenv-exe.md) instead.

- If you get an error message that says **Invalid project configuration**, make sure that you've specified a solution platform or project platform (for example, `Debug|Win32`).

## Examples

The following command builds the project `CSharpWinApp`, using the `Debug` project build configuration within `MySolution`.

```shell
devenv "%USERPROFILE%\source\repos\MySolution.sln" /build Debug /project "CSharpWinApp\CSharpWinApp.csproj" /projectconfig Debug
```

And to clean up all the build files:

```shell
devenv "%USERPROFILE%\source\repos\MySolution.sln" /clean
```

## Build a setup project

To build an installer (`.msi` file), you need a [setup project](../../deployment/installer-projects-net-core.md), which has a `.vdproj` project file, but to build it you first need to apply a workaround that sets a particular registry key. From the Visual Studio Developer command prompt, run the executable *DisableOutOfProcBuild.exe* from the folder *Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\VSI\DisableOutOfProcBuild*. Without this workaround, you may get the error: `ERROR: An error occurred while validating.  HRESULT = '8000000A'`. The command affects the current user, so for build agent scenarios, be sure to run it from the same account that runs the build. For more information, see the *README.txt* file in the same folder.

Also, in Visual Studio, you can create a new [configuration](../../ide/understanding-build-configurations.md), say `Setup`, based on the `Release` configuration, and select the setup project as a project to build. By default, setup projects aren't included in the default configurations, `Debug` and `Release`. With the `Setup` configuration defined, the following commands build a project `WindowsFormsApp1` and its associated setup project to generate the `.msi` file:

```shell
devenv WindowsFormsApp1.sln /build Setup
```

If the solution was already built with the **Release** configuration, this command just builds the setup project.
