# .NET code refactoring options

The code refactoring options in this article apply to both C# and Visual Basic.

The options described in this article don't have a severity and don't appear in the Error List as warnings or suggestions. Instead, they're only used during a refactoring in Visual Studio.

For .NET code style rules that apply during build and refactoring, that is, those that have an ID of the form `IDEXXXX`, see [Code style rules](/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/).

Example *.editorconfig* file:

```ini
# .NET formatting rules
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_style_operator_placement_when_wrapping = end_of_line
```

## dotnet\_style\_operator\_placement\_when_wrapping

Use this option to customize how you want operators placed when wrapping lines of code during a refactor.
