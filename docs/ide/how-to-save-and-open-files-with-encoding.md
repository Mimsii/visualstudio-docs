# Save and open files with encoding

You can save files with specific character encoding in Visual Studio to support bidirectional languages. You can also specify an encoding when you open a file to ensure Visual Studio displays the file correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio. If you don't have Visual Studio, go to the [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?cid=learn-onpage-download-cta) page to install it for free.

## Save file with encoding

Follow these steps to save your file with encoding:

1. In Visual Studio, select **File** > **Save <Filename\> As** for the file you want to save.

1. In the **Save File As** dialog, expand the **Save** dropdown menu and select **Save with Encoding**:

1. In the **Advanced Save Options** dialog, use the **Encoding** dropdown list to select the desired encoding for the file.

1. (Optional) Use the **Line endings** dropdown list to select the desired format for end-of-line characters.

   This option is useful if you intend to exchange the file with users of a different operating system.

   If you want to work with a file with a specific encoding, you can instruct Visual Studio to use that encoding when it opens the file. The method you use depends on whether the file is part of your project.

1. To save the file, select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> To save the project file with encoding, first unload the project. The **Save File As** option isn't enabled until you unload the project.

## Open encoded file with project

To open an encoded file located within a project, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio **Solution Explorer**, right-click the file and select **Open With**.

1. In the **Open With** dialog, select the program to open the file, and select **OK**.

   Many Visual Studio editors, such as the forms editor, can autodetect the encoding and open the file appropriately.
   
   If you choose an editor that allows you to specify an encoding, the **Encoding** dialog opens:

   - In the **Encoding** dialog, select the encoding for the editor to use, and select **OK**.

Visual Studio opens your file.

## Open encoded file without project

To open an encoded file *not* located within a project, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio, select **File** > **Open**, and then select **File**.

1. In the **Open File** dialog, browse to the file to open, and select the file.

1. Expand the **Open** dropdown menu and select **Open With**.

1. To complete this process, follow Step 2 in the [previous procedure](#open-encoded-file-with-project).
