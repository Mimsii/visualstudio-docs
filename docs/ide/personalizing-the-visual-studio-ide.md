# Customize the Visual Studio IDE

You can customize Visual Studio IDE settings in various ways to best support your own development style and requirements. Many of your settings roam with you across Visual Studio instances. See [Synchronized settings](../ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio.md). This article briefly describes different personalizations and where you can find more information.

## Default environment settings for Visual Studio

In Visual Studio, you can optimize your development environment for the type of development work you do by selecting **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**. You can use the wizard to import or export specific categories of setting, or to reset the environment to one of the default collections of settings. Each collection of settings optimizes elements such as keyboard shortcuts, window layouts, project and item templates, and command visibility.

### Reset all settings

You can also use the wizard to reset the environment to one of the default collections of settings.

1. From the menu bar, select **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**.

1. In the **Import and Export Settings Wizard**, select **Reset all settings**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Save Current Settings** page, select either **Yes, save my current settings** or **No, just reset settings, overwriting my current settings**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Choose a Default Collection of Settings** page, select a collection, and then select **Finish**.

1. On the **Reset Complete** page, select **Close**.

## General environment options

Many personalization options are exposed through the [Environment Options](../ide/reference/general-environment-options-dialog-box.md) dialog box. There are two ways to access this dialog box:

- On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options**, and if necessary, expand the **Environment** node.

- Press **Ctrl**+**Q**, enter *environment* in the search box, and then select **Environment** > **General** from the results.

> [!TIP]
> When the Options dialog box appears, you can select **F1** for help on the various settings on that page.

## Environment color themes

To change the color theme between Dark, Light, Blue, and Blue (Extra Contrast), enter *theme* in the search box, and then choose **Environment** > **General**. In the **Options** dialog box, change the **Color theme** option.

To change colorization options in the editor, enter *environment* in the search box, and then choose **Environment** > **Fonts and Colors**. See [Change fonts, colors, and themes](how-to-change-fonts-and-colors-in-visual-studio.md).

You can also use the **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Fonts and Colors** to establish a custom font and color scheme for various user interface elements in the integrated development environment (IDE). See the reference page on [Fonts and Colors, Environment, Options dialog box](./reference/fonts-and-colors-environment-options-dialog-box.md).

## Customize menus and toolbars

To add or remove menu or toolbar items, see [Customize menus and toolbars](../ide/how-to-customize-menus-and-toolbars-in-visual-studio.md).

### Main menu casing

You can change the main menu casing between **Title Case** ("File") and **All Caps** ("FILE"). Enter *environment* in the search box, select **Environment** > **General**, and then change the **Apply title case styling to menu bar** option.

## Window layouts

You can define and save multiple window layouts and switch between them. For example, you can define one layout for coding and one for debugging. To arrange window positions and behavior and save custom layouts, see [Customize window layouts and personalize tabs](../ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio.md).

## External tools

You can customize the **Tools** menu to launch external tools. For more information, see [Manage external tools](../ide/managing-external-tools.md).
