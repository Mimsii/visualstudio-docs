#customer intent: As a developer, I want to learn how to create Visual Studio projects and solutions to store artifacts so that I can effectively manage my solutions.

# Create, work with, and delete Visual Studio projects and solutions

In this article, you learn how to create Visual Studio projects from scratch and use them to store the artifacts you need to build your apps. If you aren't familiar with projects in Visual Studio, see [this overview of Projects and Solutions](solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio.md). To learn how to quickly create a project from a template, see [Create a new project in Visual Studio](create-new-project.md).

*Projects* hold the items needed to build your app in Visual Studio, such as source code files, bitmaps, icons, and component and service references. When you create a new project, Visual Studio creates a *solution* to contain the project. You can then add other new or existing projects to the solution if you want. You can also create [blank or empty solutions](#create-empty-solutions). Solutions can also contain files that aren't connected to any specific project.

You can view your solutions and projects in a tool window called *Solution Explorer*. The following screenshot shows an example of a C# console solution in Solution Explorer. The solution contains two projects: **Calculator** and **CalculatorLibrary**. Each project contains multiple files and folders. The project name in bold is the *startup project*; that is, the project that starts when you run the app. You can specify which project is the startup project.

Although you can construct a project yourself by adding the necessary files to it, Visual Studio offers a selection of project templates to give you a head start. Creating a new project from a template gives you a project that has the essentials for that project type. You can rename the files or add new or existing code and other resources to the project as needed.

That said, you don't need to use solutions and projects to develop apps in Visual Studio. You can also open code that you have cloned from Git or downloaded from another source. For more information, see [Develop code in Visual Studio without projects or solutions](../ide/develop-code-in-visual-studio-without-projects-or-solutions.md).

## Create a project by using a project template

For information about how to select a template to create a project, see [Create a new project in Visual Studio](create-new-project.md). To construct a sample project and solution as an exercise, see [Introduction to projects and solutions](../get-started/tutorial-projects-solutions.md).

## Create a project from existing code files

If you have a collection of code source files, you can easily add them to a project.

1. On the Visual Studio menu, select **File** > **New** > **Project From Existing Code**.

1. In the **Create Project from Existing Code Files Wizard**, select the project type you want in the **What type of project would you like to create?** list, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Specify Project Details** page, browse to the location of the files and then enter a name for the new project in the **Name** box. When you're done, select **Finish**.

> [!NOTE]
> This option works best for a relatively simple collection of files. Currently, only C++, Visual Basic, and C# project types are supported.

## Add files to a solution

If you have a file that applies to multiple projects, like a readme file for the solution, or other files that logically belong at the solution level rather than under a specific project, you can add them to the solution itself. To add an item to a solution, on the context (right-click) menu of the solution node in Solution Explorer, select **Add** > **New Item** or **Add** > **Existing Item**.

> [!TIP]
> A solution file is a structure for organizing projects in Visual Studio. It contains the state of solution information in two files: an *.sln* (text-based, shared) file and an *.suo* (binary, hidden, user-specific solution options) file. Therefore, you shouldn't copy and rename a solution. It's best to create a new solution and then add existing items to it.

### Compare files

Starting with [version 17.7](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes), you can compare files in Solution Explorer by using the right-click context menu options. For more information, see [The file comparison tool](use-solution-explorer.md#the-file-comparison-tool) in [Learn about Solution Explorer](use-solution-explorer.md).

## Copy files between Visual Studio instances

With Visual Studio version 17.12 and later, you can now copy and paste code files and folders between different Visual Studio instances using the Solution Explorer.

1. Select the desired file or folder in Solution Explorer.
1. Copy or cut the selected file or folder using **Ctrl+C** or **Ctrl+X**.
1. Switch to another Visual Studio instance where you want to paste the file or folder.
1. Paste the file or folder using **Ctrl+V** to include those files or folders in your new solution.

All copied changes will be accurately reflected in the file system.

In addition to copy and paste, you can also drag the files and folders from one instance of Visual Studio to another.

## Create a .NET project that targets a specific version of the .NET Framework

When you create a .NET Framework project, you can specify a specific version of the .NET Framework that you want the project to use. (When you create a .NET Core project, you don't specify a framework version.)

To specify a .NET Framework version, select an item in the **Framework** list on the **Configure your new project** page.

## Create empty solutions

You can also create empty solutions that don't contain projects. This option might work well when you want to construct your solution and projects from scratch.

### To create an empty solution

1. On the menu bar, select **File** > **New** > **Project**.

1. On the **Create a new project** page, enter **solution** in the search box.

1. Select the **Blank Solution** template, and then select **Next**.

1. Enter **Solution name** and **Location** values for your solution, and then select **Create**.

After you create an empty solution, you can add new or existing projects or items to it by selecting **Add New Item** or **Add Existing Item** on the **Project** menu.

As noted earlier, you can also open code files without using a project or solution. To learn about developing code in this way, see [Develop code in Visual Studio without projects or solutions](../ide/develop-code-in-visual-studio-without-projects-or-solutions.md).

## Multi-project solution

You can create a solution that contains multiple projects. Start with an [empty solution](#create-empty-solutions) or a [solution containing a project](#create-a-project-by-using-a-project-template) and add multiple new or existing projects to it by using **Add** > **New project**/**Existing project**. For example, you can create a solution that contains a C# project and a Visual Basic project. 

To learn more about building a solution that contains multiple projects, see [Create and remove project dependencies](how-to-create-and-remove-project-dependencies.md) and [Set multiple startup projects](how-to-set-multiple-startup-projects.md).

## Delete a solution, project, or item

You can use the right-click context menu to delete or remove solutions, projects, or items in Visual Studio, but that only removes them from the current solution or project.

To permanently delete a solution or other components from your system, use File Explorer in Windows to delete the folder that contains the *.sln* and *.suo* solution files. (Before you delete a solution, you might want to back up your projects and files in case you need them again.)

> [!NOTE]
> The *.suo* file is a hidden file that isn't displayed if you use the default File Explorer settings. To show hidden files, on the **View** menu in File Explorer, select **Show** > **Hidden items**.

### Permanently delete a solution

You can access File Explorer in Windows by using Solution Explorer in Visual Studio. Here's how.

1. In Solution Explorer, on the right-click menu of the solution you want to delete, select **Open Folder in File Explorer**.

1. In File Explorer, navigate up one level.

1. Select the folder that contains the solution, and then select the Delete key.
