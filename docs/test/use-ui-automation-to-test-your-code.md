# Use Coded UI tests to test your code

Coded UI tests (CUITs) drive your application through its user interface (UI). These tests include functional testing of the UI controls. They let you verify that the whole application, including its user interface, is functioning correctly. Coded UI tests are useful where there is validation or other logic in the user interface, for example in a web page. They are also frequently used to automate an existing manual test.

For the most current documentation, see [Use Coded UI tests to test your code](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2017/test/use-ui-automation-to-test-your-code).

[!INCLUDE [coded-ui-test-deprecation](includes/coded-ui-test-deprecation.md)]

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Enterprise 2019*
- Coded UI test component

> [!NOTE]
> \* Visual Studio 2019 is the last version to provide test creation via the recorder. Only basic minimal support for Coded UI Test is available in Visual Studio 2022.
