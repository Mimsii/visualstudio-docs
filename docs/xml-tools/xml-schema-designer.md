# XML Schema Designer overview

The XML Schema Designer (XSD Designer) is a graphical tool that allows you to visualize a schema set at different levels of abstraction. The main components of the XSD Designer are:

- [XML Schema Explorer](../xml-tools/xml-schema-explorer.md), which enables you to browse and navigate the XML Schema tree and perform searches.

- The [Start View](../xml-tools/start-view.md), which is the launching point for the XSD Designer. From the Start View, you can navigate to other views of the XSD Designer and see the details of your schema set.

- The [Graph View](../xml-tools/graph-view.md), which enables you to see an overview of a schema set and the relationships between the schema nodes.

- The [Content Model View](../xml-tools/content-model-view.md), which provides a graphical representation of the details of local and global schema nodes, including simple and complex types, elements, groups, attributes, and attribute groups.

> [!NOTE]
> XSD Designer components support XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.0.
