# Tutorial: Create a Windows Forms matching game app

In this series of four tutorials, you create a matching game. The player matches pairs of hidden icons.

Use these tutorials to learn about the following tasks in the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE):

- Store objects, such as icons, in a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> object.
- Use a `foreach` loop in C# or a `For Each` loop in Visual Basic to iterate through items in a list.
- Keep track of a form's state by using reference variables.
- Create an event handler to respond to events that you can use with multiple objects.
- Create a timer that counts down and then fires an event exactly once after it's started.

When you finish, you'll have a complete game.

## Prerequisites

You need Visual Studio to complete this tutorial. Visit the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) for a free version.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial requires the **Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)** project template. During installation, select the **.NET desktop development** workload:

> If you already have Visual Studio installed and need to add the template, from the menu, select **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features**, or in the **Create a new project** window, select **Install more tools and features**.

## Create a Windows Forms match game project

The first step of creating your game is to create a Windows Forms App project.

1. Open Visual Studio.

1. In the start window, select **Create a new project**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-windows-forms-create-match-game/create-new-project-dark-theme.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a new project option in the Visual Studio start window.":::

1. In the **Create a new project** window, search for *Windows Forms*. Then select **Desktop** from the **All project types** list.

1. Select the **Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)** template for either C# or Visual Basic, and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Configure your new project** window, name your project **MatchingGame**, and then select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorial-windows-forms-create-match-game/configure-new-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Configure your new project window.":::

Visual Studio creates a *solution* for your app.
A solution is a container for the projects and files that your app needs.

At this point, Visual Studio displays an empty form in the Windows Forms Designer.

## Create a layout for your game

In this section, you create the four-by-four grid for the game.

1. Select the form to select the Windows Forms Designer. The tab reads **Form1.cs [Design]** for C# or **Form1.vb [Design]** for Visual Basic. In the **Properties** window, set the following form properties.

   - Change the **Text** property from **Form1** to **Matching Game**. This text appears at the top of the game window.
   - Set the size of the form. You can change it either by setting the **Size** property to **550, 550** or by dragging the corner of the form until you see the correct size at the bottom of the Visual Studio IDE.

1. Select the **Toolbox** tab on the left side of the IDE.
   If you don't see it, select **View** > **Toolbox** from the menu bar or select **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**X**.

1. Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control from the **Containers** category in the toolbox, or double-click it.
   Set the following properties for the panel in the **Properties** window.

   - Set the **BackColor** property to **CornflowerBlue**.
     To set this property, select the down arrow next to the **BackColor** property.
     In the resulting dialog box, select **Web**.
     In the list of names, select **CornflowerBlue**.

     > [!NOTE]
     > The colors aren't in alphabetical order. **CornflowerBlue** is near the bottom of the list.

   - Set the **Dock** property to **Fill** by selecting the down arrow and then selecting the large middle button.
     This option spreads the table out so that it covers the entire form.
   - Set the **CellBorderStyle** property to **Inset**.
     This value provides visual borders between each cell on the board.
   - Select the triangle button in the upper-right corner of the TableLayoutPanel to display its task menu.
     On the task menu, select **Add Row** twice to add two more rows.
     Then select **Add Column** twice to add two more columns.
   - On the task menu, select **Edit Rows and Columns** to open the **Column and Row Styles** window.
     For each column, select the **Percent** option, and then set each column's width to **25** percent.
   - Select **Rows** from the list at the top of the window, and then set each row's height to **25** percent.
   - When you're done, select **OK** to save your changes.

Your TableLayoutPanel is now a four-by-four grid with 16 equally sized square cells.
These rows and columns are where the icons appear later.

## Add and format labels

In this section, you create and format labels that appear during the game.

1. Be certain that the TableLayoutPanel is selected in the form editor.
   You should see **tableLayoutPanel1** at the top of the **Properties** window.
   If it isn't selected, select the TableLayoutPanel on the form, or select it from the list at the top of the **Properties** window.

1. Open the toolbox, as before, and open the **Common Controls** category.
   Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control to the upper-left cell of the TableLayoutPanel.
   The label control is now selected in the IDE.
   Set the following properties for it.

   - Set the **BackColor** property of the label to **CornflowerBlue**.
   - Set the **AutoSize** property to **False**.
   - Set the **Dock** property to **Fill**.
   - Set the **TextAlign** property to **MiddleCenter** by selecting the down arrow button next to the property and then selecting the middle button.
     This value ensures the icon appears in the middle of the cell.
   - Select the **Font** property. An ellipsis (**...**) button appears.
     Select the ellipsis and set the **Font** value to **Webdings**, the **Font Style** to **Bold**, and the **Size** to **48**.
   - Set the **Text** property of the label to the letter **c**.

   The upper-left cell of the TableLayoutPanel now contains a black box centered on a blue background.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Webdings is an icon font that ships with the Windows operating system.
   > In your matching game, the player matches pairs of icons.
   > This font displays the icons to match.
   > If the Webdings icons don't display properly on the form, set the [**UseCompatibleTextRendering** property](/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.label.usecompatibletextrendering) of labels on the form to **True**.
   >
   > Instead of **c**, try different letters in the **Text** property.
   > An exclamation point is a spider, an uppercase N is an eye, and a comma is a chili pepper.

1. Select your Label control and copy it to the next cell in the TableLayoutPanel.
   Select the **Ctrl**+**C** keys, or on the menu bar, **Edit** > **Copy**.
   Then paste it by using **Ctrl**+**V**  or **Edit** > **Paste**.

   A copy of the first Label appears in the second cell of the TableLayoutPanel.
   Paste it again, and another Label appears in the third cell. Keep pasting Label controls until all of the cells are filled.

This step completes the layout for your form.
