# Publish Python web apps to Azure App Service on Linux

Visual Studio provides the capability to publish a Python web app directly to Azure App Service on Linux. Publishing to Azure App Service on Linux includes copying the necessary files to the server and setting up an appropriate `web.config` file that instructs the web server how to launch your app.

> [!NOTE]
> Linux is the only operating system option for running Python apps in App Service. Python on Windows is no longer supported, as described in [App Service Linux Docs - Python Support](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/Runtime_Support/python_support.md). For Windows, you can build your own custom Windows container image and run the image in App Service. For more information, see [Use a custom Docker image](/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container). 

## Prerequisites 

- Visual Studio. To install the product, follow the steps in [Install Visual Studio](../install/install-visual-studio.md).

- A Python web app project based on the Bottle, Flask, or Django framework. You can [create a test project](#create-a-test-project) to try the publishing process. 

- To publish to Azure, you need a target Azure App Service for your Azure subscription.

   If you don't already have an Azure subscription, start with a [free full Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). Also consider signing up for [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/dev-essentials/).

### Visual Studio versions

The publishing process differs between Visual Studio 2017 and later and Visual Studio 2015. Both approaches are described in this article.

- Visual Studio 2015 automates some of the installation steps, including creation of the `web.config` file, but this automation limits long-term flexibility and control.

- Visual Studio 2017 and later requires more manual installation steps, but it provides more exact control over your Python environment.

For more information about the changes between Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017 and later, see the blog post, [Publish to Azure in Visual Studio 2017](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/publish-to-azure-in-vs-2017/).

### Create a test project 

If you don't have an existing project to publish, you can create a test project to try the process.

1. In Visual Studio, select **File > New > Project** from the toolbar menu to open the **Create a new project** dialog.

1. In the dialog, enter *bottle* in the **Search** box, select the **Bottle Web Project** template, and then select **Next**.

   The Bottle Web Project template is included with the Python development workload. For more information, see [Python web application project templates](python-web-application-project-templates.md).

1. Enter a name and a path location for the project, then select **Create**. 

1. Follow the prompts to install external packages, select **Install into a virtual environment**, and choose your preferred base interpreter for the virtual environment.

   The virtual environment typically matches the version of Python installed on App Service.

When you're ready, you can test the project locally by selecting **Debug > Start Debugging** or use the keyboard shortcut **F5**.

## Create the target Azure App Service

Publishing to Azure requires a target Azure App Service for an Azure subscription.

Create an App Service with an empty web app as follows:

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to the **App Services** page.

1. Select **Create** and choose **Web App** from the dropdown menu. The **Create Web App** page opens.

1. On the **Basics** tab, configure the following settings:

   | Setting | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Resource Group** | Ignore this field. The system updates this value after you choose the runtime setting. |
   | **Name** | Enter a name for the web app. |
   | **Publish** | Select **Code**. | 
   | **Runtime stack** | Choose the appropriate Python runtime from the dropdown menu. After you choose an item, the system updates the **Resource Group** field. |
   | **Region** | Select any Azure region near you. |
   | **Pricing plan** | Select the **Free F1** plan. |

   For the examples in this article, you can ignore the settings on the other tabs.

1. Select **Review + Create**. Review your selections, and then select **Create**.

1. (Optional) After the App Service is ready, you can go to the resource, select **Download publish profile**, and save the file locally.

## Configure Python on Azure App Service

After you have an App Service with an empty web app running in your subscription, install your desired version of Python. For publishing from Visual Studio 2017 and later, record the exact path to the Python interpreter installed with the site extension. For more information, see [Install Python interpreters](installing-python-interpreters.md).

If desired, you can also install the `bottle` package. However, this package is installed in a later step in this walkthrough. 

## Publish to App Service - Visual Studio 2017 and later

Publishing to Azure App Service from Visual Studio 2017 and later copies only the files in your project to the server. You need to create the necessary files to configure the server environment.

1. In Visual Studio **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select **Add > New Item**. In the dialog, select the **Azure web.config (Fast CGI)** template, and select **Add**. This step creates a `web.config` file in your project root.

1. Modify the `PythonHandler` entry in the `web.config` file so the path matches the Python installation on the server, as described in [IIS Configuration Reference](https://www.iis.net/configreference) (iis.net). For example, for Python 3.6.1 x64 the entry should appear as follows:

   ```xml
   <system.webServer>
     <handlers>
       <add name="PythonHandler" path="*" verb="*" modules="FastCgiModule"
           scriptProcessor="D:\home\Python361x64\python.exe|D:\home\Python361x64\wfastcgi.py"
           resourceType="Unspecified" requireAccess="Script"/>
     </handlers>
   </system.webServer>
   ```

1. Set the `WSGI_HANDLER` entry in the `web.config` file as appropriate for the framework you're using:

   - **Bottle**: Add parentheses after the `app.wsgi_app` value as shown in this example. The parentheses are necessary because the object is a function rather than a variable. You can see the syntax in the `app.py` file.

     ```xml
     <!-- Bottle apps only -->
     <add key="WSGI_HANDLER" value="app.wsgi_app()"/>
     ```

   - **Flask**: Change the `WSGI_HANDLER` value to `<project_name>.app` where `<project_name>` matches the name of your project. You can find the exact identifier by looking at the `from <project_name> import app` statement in the `runserver.py` file. For example, if the project is named "FlaskAzurePublishExample," the entry appears as follows:

      ```xml
      <!-- Flask apps only: Change the project name to match your app -->
      <add key="WSGI_HANDLER" value="FlaskAzurePublishExample.app"/>
      ```

   - **Django**: Two changes are needed to the `web.config` file for Django projects.
   
      - Change the `WSGI_HANDLER` value to `django.core.wsgi.get_wsgi_application()`. The object is in the `wsgi.py` file.

         ```xml
         <!-- Django apps only -->
         <add key="WSGI_HANDLER" value="django.core.wsgi.get_wsgi_application()"/>
         ```

      - Add the following entry immediately after the entry for the `WSGI_HANDLER` key. Replace the value `DjangoAzurePublishExample` with the name of your project:

         ```xml
         <add key="DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE" value="django_iis_example.settings" />
         ```

1. **Django apps only**: In the Django project's `settings.py` file, add your site URL domain or IP address to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` entry. Replace 'vspython-test-02.azurewebsites.net' with your URL:

   ```python
   # Change the URL to your specific site
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['vspython-test-02.azurewebsites.net']
   ```

   If you don't add your URL to the array results, you see the following error:

   ```output
   DisallowedHost at / Invalid HTTP_HOST header: '\<site URL\>'. You might need to add '\<site URL\>' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
   ```

   When the array is empty, Django automatically allows `'localhost'` as a host. If you add your production URL, `'localhost'` isn't automatically allowed as a host. For this reason, you might want to maintain separate development and production copies of the `settings.py` file, or use environment variables to control the runtime values.

1. Select the template.

   1. In **Solution Explorer**, expand your project folder.
   1. Right-click the *static* folder, and select **Add > New Item**.
   1. Select the **Azure Static files web.config** template, and select **Add**.
   
   This action creates another `web.config` file in the *static* folder that disables Python processing for that folder. This configuration sends requests for static files to the default web server rather than using the Python application.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, save your project, and then right-click your project and select **Publish**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/template-web-publish-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to access the Publish command for a project in Visual Studio." border="false" lightbox="media/template-web-publish-command.png":::

1. In the **Publish** window, specify the publishing target:

   1. For the **Target**, select **Azure**, and then select **Next**.

   1. For the **Specific target**, select **Azure App Service (Windows)**, and select **Next**.
      
      - If the dialog indicates that other **Required components** are necessary to complete the installation, select **Finish**. The Visual Studio Installer opens. Confirm the options, and select **Install**.

   1. For the **App Service**, select the appropriate App Service for your subscription, and select **Finish**.

      After the publish creation process completes, select **Close**.

1. Visual Studio displays status in a "Web Publish Activity" window and also in the **Publish profile creation progress** window. When you see the "Ready to publish" message for the web app, select **Publish**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorials-common-publish-2022-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to Publish the web app in Visual Studio." border="false" lightbox="media/tutorials-common-publish-2022-2.png":::

1. When publishing succeeds, the default browser opens on the site URL. The site URL is also shown in the **Publish** window.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorials-common-publish-2022-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the browser opened to the site URL for the published web app." border="false" lightbox="media/tutorials-common-publish-2022-3.png":::

   If the site URL doesn't automatically open, select **Open site** to view the web app in the browser:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorials-common-publish-2022-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to open the site URL for the published web app in the browser." border="false" lightbox="media/tutorials-common-publish-2022-4.png":::

1. When the browser opens, you might see the message, "The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred." This message indicates that your Python environment on the server isn't fully configured, in which case do the following steps:

   1. Make sure you have an appropriate Python site extension installed. For more information, see 
   [Quickstart: Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app to Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/quickstart-python).

   1. Double-check the path to the Python interpreter in your `web.config` file. The path must exactly match the install location of your chosen site extension.

   1. Use the Kudu console to upgrade any packages listed in your app's `requirements.txt` file. Browse to the same Python folder used in the `web.config` file, such as `/home/python361x64`. Run the following command, as described in the [Kudu console](managing-python-on-azure-app-service.md#azure-app-service-kudu-console) section:

      ```console
      python -m pip install --upgrade -r /home/site/wwwroot/requirements.txt
      ```

      If you see permission errors when you run this command, confirm you're running the command in your site extension folder. Don't run the command in a folder that has one of App Service's default Python installations. Because you can't modify those default environments, attempting to install packages certainly fails.

   1. For detailed error output, add the following line to the `web.config` file within the `<system.webServer>` node, which provides more detailed error output:

      ```xml
      <httpErrors errorMode="Detailed"></httpErrors>
      ```

   1. Try restarting the App Service after installing new packages. A restart isn't necessary when changing the `web.config` file, as App Service does an automatic restart whenever the `web.config` file changes.

      > [!TIP]
      > If you make any changes to your app's `requirements.txt` file, be sure to again use the Kudu console to install any packages that are now listed in that file.

1. After you fully configure the server environment, refresh the page in the browser to see the web app:

## Publish to App Service - Visual Studio 2015

Follow these steps to publish your Python web app to Azure App Service in Visual Studio 2015.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select **Publish**.

1. In the **Publish** dialog, select **Microsoft Azure App Service**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorials-common-publish-2015-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to Publish to Azure in Visual Studio and select an Azure App Service." border="false" lightbox="media/tutorials-common-publish-2015-1.png":::

1. Select **Microsoft Azure App Service** as the publishing target. In the next dialog, select an existing App Service or select **New** to create a new one.

1. The App Service details appear in the **Connection** tab of the **Publish** dialog:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorials-common-publish-2015-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to Publish to Azure in Visual Studio and view the App Service connection." border="false" lightbox="media/tutorials-common-publish-2015-2.png":::

1. As needed, select **Next** to review other settings.

1. Select **Publish**. After your application deploys to Azure, your default browser opens on the site URL.

As part of this process, Visual Studio also completes the following steps:

- Creates a `web.config` file on the server that contains appropriate pointers to the app's `wsgi_app` function and to App Service's default Python 3.4 interpreter.
- Turns off processing for files in the project's *static* folder. (The rules for this action are in the `web.config` file.)
- Publishes the virtual environment to the server.
- Adds a `web.debug.config` file and the debugging tools to enable remote debugging. For Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 and earlier, the debugging tools are ptvsd. For Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5 and later, the debugging tools are debugpy.

As mentioned earlier, these automatic steps simplify the publishing process, but they can make it more difficult to control the Python environment. For example, the `web.config` file is created only on the server but not added to your project. The publishing process also takes longer because it's copying the whole virtual environment from your development computer rather than relying on the server configuration.

Eventually, you might want to maintain your own `web.config` file and use the `requirements.txt` file to maintain packages on the server directly. When you use the `requirements.txt` file, in particular, you can help guarantee that your development and server environments always match.
