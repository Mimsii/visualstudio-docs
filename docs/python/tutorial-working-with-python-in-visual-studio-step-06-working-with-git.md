# Tutorial: Work with Git in Visual Studio

This article presents Step 6 in the tutorial series _Work with Python in Visual Studio_.

Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes to your code files and projects. By storing your Python project files in Git, you can enable multiple developers to contribute to your files and maintain the integrity of your project over time.

In the previous Steps in this tutorial, you create a Python application and make various changes to the code. In Step 6, you can add your application to a Git repository. You explore how to work with Git tools in Visual Studio to provide source control for your Python projects.

In Step 6 of the tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

- A Python application project that has a Python file (_.py_) with code created in [Step 2: Write and run Python code](tutorial-working-with-python-in-visual-studio-step-02-writing-code.md).

- Although not required to proceed with this Step, review the instructions in [Step 3](tutorial-working-with-python-in-visual-studio-step-03-interactive-repl.md), [Step 4](tutorial-working-with-python-in-visual-studio-step-04-debugging.md), and [Step 5](tutorial-working-with-python-in-visual-studio-step-05-installing-packages.md) of this tutorial for an end-to-end Python workflow in Visual Studio.
