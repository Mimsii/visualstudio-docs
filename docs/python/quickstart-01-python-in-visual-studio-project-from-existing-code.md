# Quickstart: Create Python project from existing code in Visual Studio

In this quickstart, you follow guided steps to quickly create a new Python project from existing code. Visual Studio makes it easy to bring your Python code into a Visual Studio project with the **Create New Project from Existing Python Code** wizard.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio installed with support for Python workloads. For more information, see [Install Python support in Visual Studio](installing-python-support-in-visual-studio.md).

Visual Studio for Mac isn't supported. For more information, see [What's happening to Visual Studio for Mac?](/visualstudio/mac/what-happened-to-vs-for-mac) Visual Studio Code on Windows, Mac, and Linux [works well with Python through available extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).

## Use wizard to create project from existing files

[!INCLUDE[project-from-existing](includes/project-from-existing.md)]

Now you can run your program by selecting **Debug** > **Start without Debugging** on the Visual Studio main toolbar or use the **Ctrl**+**F5** keyboard shortcut.
