# Tutorial: Run code in the Debugger in Visual Studio

This article presents Step 4 in the tutorial series _Work with Python in Visual Studio_.

Visual Studio provides capabilities to manage projects, a rich editing experience, the **Interactive Window**, and full-featured debugging for Python code. In Step 4 of this tutorial series, you use the **Debugger** to run your code step by step, including every iteration of a loop. In the **Debugger**, you can pause your program whenever certain conditions are true. At any point when the program is paused, you can examine the entire program state and change the value of variables. Such actions are essential for tracking down program bugs, and also provide helpful aids for following the exact program flow.

In Step 4 of the tutorial, you learn how to:

> - Run Python code in the **Debugger** in Visual Studio
> - Set breakpoints and conditions
> - Examine program state and change variables
> - Explore **Debugger** windows and actions

## Prerequisites

- A Python application project that has a Python file (_.py_) with code created in [Step 2: Write and run Python code](tutorial-working-with-python-in-visual-studio-step-02-writing-code.md) and [Step 3: Use the Interactive REPL window](./tutorial-working-with-python-in-visual-studio-step-03-interactive-repl.md) of this tutorial.

## Prepare the Python file

To prepare for the debugging exercise, follow these steps to update your Python project file to include more robust code:

1. Open your Python project file (_.py_) in the editor.

1. Replace the code in the file with the following code. This version of the code expands the `make_dot_string` function so you can examine its discrete steps in the debugger. It moves the `for` loop into a `main` function and runs it explicitly by calling the `main` function:

   ```python
   from math import cos, radians

   # Create a string with spaces proportional to a cosine of x in degrees
   def make_dot_string(x):
       rad = radians(x)                             # cos works with radians
       numspaces = int(20 * cos(rad) + 20)          # Scale to 0-40 spaces
       st = ' ' * numspaces + 'o'                   # Place 'o' after the spaces
       return st

   def main():
       for i in range(0, 1800, 12):
           s = make_dot_string(i)
           print(s)

   main()
   ```

## Start debugging

Now you're ready to start checking your updated Python code in the **Debugger**.

1. Confirm the code works properly by selecting **Debug** > **Start Debugging** on the toolbar or use the **F5** keyboard shortcut. These commands run the code in the **Debugger**.

   The **Debugger** doesn't detect any issues, so the program runs successfully. An output window opens and you see a few iterations of the cosine wave pattern. Select any key to close the output window.

   > [!TIP]
   > To close the output window automatically when the program completes, select **Tools** > **Options**, expand the **Python**> **Debugging** tab, and clear the **Wait for input when process exits normally** option.

1. Set a breakpoint on the `for` loop statement by using one of the following methods:

   - Select in the left margin for the line of code.
   - Right-click the line of code and select **Breakpoint** > **Insert Breakpoint**.
   - Place the insertion caret in the line of code and select **Debug** > **Toggle Breakpoint** (or use the **F9** keyboard shortcut).
 
   Breakpoints stop execution of code at a marked point so you can inspect the program state. A red dot appears on each line that has a set breakpoint.

1. Start the **Debugger** again (**F5**). The running code for the program stops on the line with the set breakpoint. You can now inspect the call stack and examine variables for this state of the running program code.
   
   Visual Studio provides many ways to observe your program code and execution data, including the following windows:
   
   - The **Call stack** shows the history of function and method calls by the program code.
   - Defined variables that are in-scope appear in the **Autos** window.
   - The **Locals** view shows all variables that Visual Studio finds in the current scope (including functions), even before they're defined in the code.

   To see the full list of available windows and actions, select **Debug** > **Windows**.
   
   You can open the **Debugger** windows to view your program state when a breakpoint is encountered:

## Use Debugger actions

When Visual Studio stops code execution at a breakpoint, there are several commands you can use to step through your code or run blocks of code before breaking again. The commands are available in a few places in Visual Studio, including the **Debugger** toolbar, the **Debug** menu, the right-click context menu in the code editor, and through keyboard shortcuts.

The **Debugger** toolbar along the top of the Visual Studio window provides quick access to the most common debugging commands:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutor-python-4-debugger-toolbar.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Debugger toolbar in Visual Studio." border="false" lightbox="media/tutor-python-4-debugger-toolbar.png":::

The following table summarizes these commands as they appear from left to right on the toolbar:

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Continue**            | **F5**                     | Run code until you reach the next breakpoint or until program completion. |
| **Break All**           | **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Break** | Pause a long-running program.  |
| **Stop Debugging**      | **Shift**+**F5**           | Stop the program at the current point, and exit the **Debugger**. |
| **Restart**             | **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**F5**  | Stop the program at the current point, and restart program execution from the beginning in the **Debugger**. |
| **Show Next Statement** | **Alt**+**Num**+**\\**     | Return to the next statement to run in the code. This command helps you locate the place in your code where the **Debugger** is stopped. |
| **Step Into**           | **F11**                    | Run the next statement and stop. If the next statement is a call to a function, the **Debugger** steps into the function and stops at the first line. |
| **Step Over**           | **F10**                    | Run the next statement, including making a call to a function (running all its code) and applying any return value. This command allows you to easily skip functions that you don't need to debug. |
| **Step Out**            | **Shift**+**F11**          | Run the code until the end of the current function, then step to the calling statement and pause. This command is useful when you don't need to debug the remainder of the current function. |

Follow these steps to work with **Debugger** actions in your Python code:

1. Step over the `for` loop statement by using the **Step Over** action.

   _Stepping_ causes the **Debugger** to run the current line of code, including any called function, and immediately pause again. After you step over, notice that the variable `i` is now defined in the **Locals** and **Autos** windows.

1. **Step Over** the next line of code, which calls the `make_dot_string` function.

   In this instance, **Step Over** causes the **Debugger** to run the complete `make_dot_string` function and pause after the return from the function. The **Debugger** doesn't stop inside the function unless a separate breakpoint exists there.

1. Continue stepping over the code a few more times and observe how the values in the **Locals** or **Autos** window change.

1. In the **Locals** or **Autos** window, double-click the **Value** column for a variable to edit the value. In this example, change the value for the `s` variable to `'Hello, Python Application'`. Be sure to enclose the value in single quotes. Select **Enter** or any area outside the value to apply your changes.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutor-python-4-change-variable.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to change the value for a variable in the Locals window during debugging in Visual Studio." border="false" lightbox="media/tutor-python-4-change-variable.png":::

1. Continue stepping through the code by using **Step Into** until the call to the `make_dot_string` function.

   For a function, **Step Into** causes the **Debugger** to both call the function and also step into the function code. When the debugging process is inside a function, you can examine its local variables and step through its code specifically. In this example, the **Step into** action moves into the `make_dot_string` function. 

1. Continue stepping with **Step Into** until the return from the `make_dot_string` function.

   When you reach the end of the `make_dot_string` function code, the next step returns the ***Debugger** to the `for` loop with the new return value in the `s` variable.
   
   As you step again to the `print` statement, notice that the **Step Into** action on the `print` statement doesn't enter into that function. This behavior is because the `print` function isn't written in Python. It's native code inside the Python runtime.

1. Continue using **Step Into** until you're again partway into the `make_dot_string` function, then use **Step Out** and notice that the **Debugger** returns to the `for` loop.

   With **Step Out**, the **Debugger** runs the remainder of the function and then automatically pauses in the calling code. This action is helpful after you step through some portion of a lengthy function and you want to end your observation of the function. **Step Out** steps through the remaining code or until it reaches an explicit breakpoint set in the calling code.

1. Continue running the program until the next breakpoint is reached by using **Continue** (**F5**). Because you have a breakpoint set in the `for` loop, you break on the next iteration.

   You can confirm the program is continuing to execute by observing the changing value for the `s` variable in the **Locals** window.

## Use breakpoint conditions

Stepping through hundreds of iterations of a loop can be tedious, so Visual Studio lets you add a _condition_ to a breakpoint. When you set a breakpoint condition, the **Debugger** pauses the program at the breakpoint only when the condition is met.

The following steps show how to define a breakpoint condition on the `for` loop statement so the **Debugger** pauses only when the value of the `i` variable exceeds 1600:

1. To set the breakpoint condition, right-click the red breakpoint dot and select **Conditions** or use the keyboard shortcut **Alt**+**F9** > **C**.

1. In the **Breakpoint Settings** popup dialog, configure the following settings to create the **Condition**:

   1. Set the condition type to **Conditional Expression**.
   
   1. Define the condition evaluation to **Is true**.
   
   1. Enter `i > 1600` as the condition value.
   
   1. Select **Close**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutor-python-4-set-breakpoint-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to set a conditional breakpoint in the Debugger in Visual Studio." border="false" lightbox="media/tutor-python-4-set-breakpoint-condition.png":::

1. Select **F5** to continue debugging and program execution. Observe that the program runs many iterations before it reaches the conditional breakpoint.

   You can confirm that the **Debugger** correctly pauses program execution when it reaches the conditional breakpoint. When the condition is met, the **Locals** window shows the `i` variable value as `1608`.

1. To run the program to completion, you can disable the breakpoint and continue the program execution.

   1. Hover over the red dot and select **Disable**, or right-click the red dot and select **Disable breakpoint**.

   1. Select **Continue** (or press **F5**) to run the program.
   
   When the program ends, Visual Studio stops the debugging session and returns to editing mode.
   
   You can also delete a breakpoint. Select the red dot or right-click the dot and select **Delete breakpoint**. This action also deletes any defined conditions.

> [!TIP]
> In some situations, such as a failure to launch the Python interpreter itself, the Python output window might close immediately after the program finishes without pausing and showing the **Press any key to continue** prompt. To force the pause and prompt, add the `-i` argument to the **Run** > **Interpreter Arguments** field on the **Debug** tab. This argument puts the Python interpreter into interactive mode after the code runs. The program waits for you to select **Ctrl**+**Z**+**Enter** to close the window.
