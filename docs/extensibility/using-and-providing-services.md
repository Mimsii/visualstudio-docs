# Using and Providing Services

A service is a contract between two VSPackages. One VSPackage offers a specific set of interfaces for another VSPackage to consume. For example, Visual Studio offers the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsActivityLog> service to any VSPackage it loads. This service provides the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsActivityLog> interface, which can be used to write to the activity log. For more information, see [How to: Use the Activity Log](../extensibility/how-to-use-the-activity-log.md).

 VSPackages can offer services of their own by using the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IProfferService> interface..

 Visual Studio offers important services, such as the following:

|IDE service|Description|
|-----------------|-----------------|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsShell>|Provides access to IDE services dealing with basic functionality, VSPackages, and the registry.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsUIShell>|Provides basic windowing and UI-related functionality in the IDE, such as the ability to create tools and document windows.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsSolution>|Provides basic solution-related functionality, such as the ability to enumerate projects, create new projects, and monitor project changes.|
