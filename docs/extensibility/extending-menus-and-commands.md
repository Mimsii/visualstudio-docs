# Extend menus and commands

Commands are the way you add actions and processes to Visual Studio. In most cases commands are displayed on menus or toolbars. The VSPackage project template shows how to implement a very basic command. For a slightly longer but still basic implementation, see [Create an extension with a menu command](../extensibility/creating-an-extension-with-a-menu-command.md).

 For more information about Visual Studio commands, menus, and toolbars, see [Commands, menus, and toolbars](../extensibility/internals/commands-menus-and-toolbars.md).

 Commands, menus, and toolbars are defined in the *.vsct* file that is part of VSPackage projects. You can find information about the Visual Studio IDE and the *.vsct* file in [How VSPackages add user interface elements](../extensibility/internals/how-vspackages-add-user-interface-elements.md).

 The following topics explain how to add different kinds of commands, menus, and toolbars.
