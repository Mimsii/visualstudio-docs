# Code context

In Visual Studio debugging, a **code context**:

- Provides an abstraction of a position in code as known to the debug engine (DE). For most run-time architectures today, a code context can be thought of as an address in a program's instruction stream. For nontraditional languages, where code may not be represented by instructions, a code context may be represented by some other means.

- Describes the current position in the execution stream of the program you're debugging.

- Exists only when a program has stopped at a breakpoint.

- Has an associated document context.

- Is implemented by an [IDebugCodeContext2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugcodecontext2.md) interface.
