# Modules

In terms of the debugger architecture, a *module*:

- Is a physical container of code, such as an executable file or a DLL.

- Can reload its symbols and describe itself. Module descriptions are displayed in the Modules window of the IDE.

- Is represented by an [IDebugModule2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugmodule2.md) interface, created by a debug engine to describe the module.
