# Breakpoint errors

The following describes the process when a breakpoint attempts to bind to code but fails.

## Troubleshoot a breakpoint error

1. The debug engine (DE) sends an [IDebugBreakpointErrorEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointerrorevent2.md) to the session debug manager (SDM).

2. The SDM calls [IDebugBreakpointErrorEvent2::GetErrorBreakpoint](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointerrorevent2-geterrorbreakpoint.md) (IDebugErrorBreakpoint2** `ppErrorBP`) to get the error breakpoint.

3. The SDM calls [IDebugErrorBreakpoint2::GetPendingBreakpoint](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugerrorbreakpoint2-getpendingbreakpoint.md) to get the pending breakpoint from which the error breakpoint originated.

4. The SDM calls [IDebugErrorBreakpoint2::GetBreakpointResolution](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugerrorbreakpoint2-getbreakpointresolution.md) to get the reason why the error breakpoint failed to bind.
