# Termination and detaching

The following section describes normal termination.

## Discussion
 After the [IDebugLoadCompleteEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugloadcompleteevent2.md) or [IDebugEntryPointEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugentrypointevent2.md) interface continues, if there are no breakpoints, exceptions, run-time errors, or infinite loops in the application to be debugged, the program being debugged runs to completion. This process is normal termination.

 You must send an [IDebugProgramDestroyEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogramdestroyevent2.md) to implement normal termination. Normal termination requires running the [IDebugProgramDestroyEvent2::GetExitCode](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogramdestroyevent2-getexitcode.md) method.
