# Hit a breakpoint

The following section describes the process when the debug engine (DE) hits a breakpoint while running or stepping:

## Troubleshoot a hit breakpoint

1. The DE sends an [IDebugBreakpointEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointevent2.md) interface as an **EVENT_SYNC_STOP**.

2. The session debug manager (SDM) calls [IDebugBreakpointEvent2:::EnumBreakpoints](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointevent2-enumbreakpoints.md) to get the breakpoint that was hit.
