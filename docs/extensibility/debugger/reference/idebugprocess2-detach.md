# IDebugProcess2::Detach

Detaches the debugger from this process by detaching all of the programs in the process.

## Syntax

### [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
int Detach();
```
### [C++](#tab/cpp)
```cpp
HRESULT Detach( 
   void 
);
```
---

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 All programs and the process continue running, but are no longer part of the debug session. After the detach operation is complete, no more debug events for this process (and its programs) will be sent.
