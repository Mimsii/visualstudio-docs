# IDebugThread2::Resume

Resumes execution of a thread.

## Syntax

### [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
int Resume ( 
   out uint pdwSuspendCount
);
```
### [C++](#tab/cpp)
```cpp
HRESULT Resume ( 
   DWORD *pdwSuspendCount
);
```
---

## Parameters
`pdwSuspendCount`\
[out] Returns the suspend count after the resume operation.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 Each call to this method decrements the suspend count until it reaches 0 at which time, execution is actually resumed. This suspend count is displayed in the **Threads** debug window.

 For each call to this method, there must be a previous call to the [Suspend](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugthread2-suspend.md) method. The suspend count determines how many times the `IDebugThread2::Suspend` method has been called so far.
