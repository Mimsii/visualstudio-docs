`pAddress`\
[in, out] A [DEBUG_ADDRESS](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-address.md) structure that is filled in by this method.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns S_OK; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 The [DEBUG_ADDRESS](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-address.md) structure is passed to this method, which then fills it in with the appropriate information.
