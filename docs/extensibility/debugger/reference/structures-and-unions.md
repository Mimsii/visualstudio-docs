- [BP_ERROR_RESOLUTION_INFO](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-error-resolution-info.md) describes the resolution of an error breakpoint, including location, program, and thread.

- [BP_LOCATION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-location.md) specifies the type of structure used to describe the location of the breakpoint.

- [BP_LOCATION_CODE_ADDRESS](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-location-code-address.md) defines the components that describe the location of a breakpoint at an address in code.

- [BP_LOCATION_CODE_CONTEXT](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-location-code-context.md) describes the location of a breakpoint that is bound directly to an address in the program being debugged.

- [BP_LOCATION_CODE_FILE_LINE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-location-code-file-line.md) describes the location of a breakpoint at line in a code source file.

- [BP_LOCATION_CODE_STRING](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-location-code-string.md) is used for setting code breakpoints based on a string that the user can enter from the IDE.

- [BP_LOCATION_DATA_STRING](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-location-data-string.md) is used for setting data breakpoints that are based on a string that the user can enter from the IDE.

- [BP_LOCATION_RESOLUTION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-location-resolution.md) describes the resolution of a breakpoint at a specific location.

- [BP_REQUEST_INFO2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-request-info2.md) contains the information required to implement a breakpoint (same as the [BP_REQUEST_INFO](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-request-info.md) structure but includes vendor GUID, constraint and tracepoint information).

- [BP_RESOLUTION_CODE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-resolution-code.md) describes the location of a code breakpoint.

- [BP_RESOLUTION_DATA](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-resolution-data.md) describes the result of binding a data breakpoint.

- [BP_RESOLUTION_INFO](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-resolution-info.md) describes the bound breakpoint information for either a code breakpoint or a data breakpoint.

- [BP_RESOLUTION_LOCATION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-resolution-location.md) specifies the structure of the breakpoint resolution location.

- [BSTR_ARRAY](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bstr-array.md) describes an array of strings.

- [BUILT_TYPE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/built-type.md) specifies information about a field type taken from metadata.

- [CODE_PATH](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/code-path.md) describes a call to a function or method.

- [COMPUTER_INFO](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/computer-info.md) describes the computer on which the debugger is running.

- [CONST_GUID_ARRAY](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/const-guid-array.md) describes a list of GUIDs.

- [CONTEXT_INFO](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/context-info.md) describes a memory context or code context.

- [DEBUG_ADDRESS_UNION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-address-union.md) represents one of a number of different kinds of addresses.

- [DEBUG_CUSTOM_VIEWER](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-custom-viewer.md) identifies a custom viewer or type visualizer.

- [DEBUG_PROPERTY_INFO](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-property-info.md) describes a debug property that in turn describes an object of a hierarchical nature that has name, type, and value.

- [DEBUG_REFERENCE_INFO](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-reference-info.md) describes a reference.

- [DisassemblyData](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/disassemblydata.md) describes disassembly to the IDE for display.

- [EXCEPTION_INFO](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/exception-info.md) describes an exception or run-time error thrown by the program being debugged.
