# IDebugProgram2::Terminate

Terminates the program.

```
### [C++](#tab/cpp)
```cpp
HRESULT Terminate( 
   void 
);
```

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 If possible, the program will be terminated and unloaded from the process; otherwise, the debug engine (DE) will perform any necessary cleanup.

 This method or the [Terminate](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprocess2-terminate.md) method is called by the IDE, typically in response to the user halting all debugging. The implementation of this method should, ideally, terminate the program within the process. If this is not possible, the DE should prevent the program from running any more in this process (and do any necessary cleanup). If the `IDebugProcess2::Terminate` method was called by the IDE, the entire process will be terminated sometime after the `IDebugProgram2::Terminate` method is called.
