# IDebugEngine2::CauseBreak

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 This method is asynchronous: an [IDebugBreakEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakevent2.md) event is sent when the program next attempts to execute after this method is called.
