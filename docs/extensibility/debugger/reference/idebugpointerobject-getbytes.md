# IDebugPointerObject::GetBytes

Gets the value pointed to as a series of consecutive bytes.

## Syntax

### [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp
int GetBytes(
   uint       dwStart,
   uint       dwCount,
   out byte[] pBytes,
   out uint   pdwBytes
);
```
### [C++](#tab/cpp)
```cpp
HRESULT GetBytes(Â 
   DWORD  dwStart,
   DWORD  dwCount,
   BYTE*  pBytes,
   DWORD* pdwBytes
);
```
---

## Parameters
`dwStart`\
[in] An offset, in bytes, from the start of the object pointed to.

`dwCount`\
[in] The number of bytes to retrieve.

`pBytes`\
[in, out] An array that is filled in with the value as a series of consecutive bytes, starting at the given offset from the object pointed to.

`pdwBytes`\
[out] Returns the number of bytes actually retrieved.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns S_OK; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 This method is used if the pointer as represented by this [IDebugPointerObject](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpointerobject.md) points to a primitive type or a simple array of primitive types (that is, an array that can be represented by a simple sequence of bytes).
