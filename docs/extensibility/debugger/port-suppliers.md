# Port suppliers

In the debugger architecture, a *port supplier*:

- Is contained by a server and provides ports on request to that server.

- Can add and remove ports from the containing server.

- Can enumerate all the ports it has supplied to the server.

- Is represented by an [IDebugPortSupplier2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportsupplier2.md) interface, which is registered with Visual Studio through the registry. This interface can be obtained by calling [GetPortSupplier](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugcoreserver2-getportsupplier.md).

  Visual Studio provides a default port supplier and a default port. If a custom port needs to be implemented, a custom port supplier also needs to be implemented to supply those custom ports.
