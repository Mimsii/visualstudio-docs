# Servers (Visual Studio SDK)

In the debugger architecture, a *server*:

- Is a container of ports and port suppliers and communicates ports and port suppliers to the session debug manager (SDM) and debug engines.

- Can identify itself by name, and enumerate its ports and port suppliers.

- Is represented by an [IDebugCoreServer2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugcoreserver2.md) interface, which is only implemented by Visual Studio (one instance of a server for each instance of Visual Studio running).
