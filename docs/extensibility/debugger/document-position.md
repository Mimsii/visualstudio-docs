# Document position

In Visual Studio debugging, a *document position*:

- Provides an abstraction of a position in a source file as known to the IDE. For most languages today, a document position can be thought of as a position in a source file.

- Describes a position in a source document to a debug engine.

- Is implemented by an [IDebugDocumentPosition2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugdocumentposition2.md) interface.
