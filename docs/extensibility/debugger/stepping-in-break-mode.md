# Stepping in break mode

The following section describes the process that occurs when the debugger is in break mode and must step through code:

## Stepping process

1. Call [IDebugProgram2::Step](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogram2-step.md) with [STEPKIND](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/stepkind.md) and [STEPUNIT](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/stepunit.md) arguments to execute a step.

2. When the step is finished, send an [IDebugStepCompleteEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugstepcompleteevent2.md) as a stopping event.
