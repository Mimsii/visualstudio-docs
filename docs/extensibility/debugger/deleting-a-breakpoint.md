# Deleting a breakpoint

The following describes the process when deleting a pending breakpoint:

## Deletion process
 The session debug manager (SDM) calls the [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Delete](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-delete.md) method to remove the pending breakpoint and all bound breakpoints bound from it.

> [!NOTE]
> A single bound breakpoint can also be deleted by a call to [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::Delete](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2-delete.md).
