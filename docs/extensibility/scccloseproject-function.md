# SccCloseProject function

This function closes a project, marking the end of a particular session.

## Syntax

```cpp
SCCRTN SccCloseProject (
   LPVOID pvContext
);
```

### Parameters
 pvContext
 The source control plug-in context structure.

## Return value
 The source control plug-in implementation of this function is expected to return one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|SCC_OK|The project was successfully closed.|
|SCC_E_PROJNOTOPEN|No project is currently open.|
|SCC_E_NOTAUTHORIZED|The user is not allowed to perform this operation.|
|SCC_E_NONSPECIFICERROR|Nonspecific failure.|

## Remarks
 The [SccOpenProject](../extensibility/sccopenproject-function.md) is always called before this function. A call to this function is then followed by a call to either the `SccOpenProject` function or the [SccUninitialize](../extensibility/sccuninitialize-function.md), which ends the connection to the source control system completely.
