# Working with solutions in Visual Studio extensions

Here's a collection of small code samples on different ways to work with solutions.

## Solution events
Listen to any solution event.

```csharp
VS.Events.SolutionEvents.OnAfterOpenProject += OnAfterOpenProject;

...

private void OnAfterOpenProject(Project obj)
{
    // Handle the event
}
```

## Is a solution open?
Check if a solution is currently open or opening.

```csharp

bool isOpen = await VS.Solutions.IsOpenAsync();
bool isOpening = await VS.Solutions.IsOpeningAsync();
```

## Get all projects in solution
Get a list of all projects in the solution.

```csharp
var projects = await VS.Solutions.GetAllProjectsAsync();
```
