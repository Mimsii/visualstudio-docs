# Get the tools needed to write Visual Studio extensions

To write extensions you have to install the extensibility workload. That's technically all you need, but this set of documentation makes use of the community driven extension called *Extensibility Essentials*. Each version of Visual Studio has its own version: [Extensibility Essentials 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.ExtensibilityEssentials2019) or [Extensibility Essentials 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.ExtensibilityEssentials2022).

The following video introduces the tools you'll need.
