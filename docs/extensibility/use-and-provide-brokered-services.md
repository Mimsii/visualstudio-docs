# Using and providing brokered services

A brokered service is a service acquired via an <xref:Microsoft.ServiceHub.Framework.IServiceBroker>, and is exposed as an RPC-compatible interface to enable the service and its client to exist in distinct AppDomains, processes or even across machines (in the case of Live Share).

VS Packages can offer services of their own by using the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ServiceBroker.IBrokeredServiceContainer> interface.

Visual Studio offers important brokered services, such as the following:

|Brokered service|Description|
|-----------------|-----------------|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.RpcContracts.OutputChannel.IOutputChannelStore>|Allows streaming text to the output window.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.RpcContracts.OpenDocument.IOpenDocumentService>|Allows opening documents.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.RpcContracts.FileSystem.IFileSystem>|Allows access to local or remote file systems.|
