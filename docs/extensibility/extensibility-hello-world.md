# Tutorial - Create your first extension: Hello World

This Hello World example walks you through creating your first extension for Visual Studio. This tutorial shows you how to add a new command to Visual Studio.

In the process, you learn how to:

* **[Create an extensibility project](#create-an-extensibility-project)**
* **[Add a custom command](#add-a-custom-command)**
* **[Modify the source code](#modify-the-source-code)**
* **[Run it](#run-it)**

For this example, you use Visual C# to add a custom menu button named "Say Hello World!" that looks like this:

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed the **Visual Studio extension development** workload, which includes the VSIX template and sample code.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use any edition of Visual Studio (Community, Professional, or Enterprise) to create a Visual Studio extensibility project.

## Create an extensibility project

1. From the **File** menu, select **New** > **Project**. Search for "vsix" and select the C# **VSIX Project** and then **Next**.

1. Enter "HelloWorld" for the **Project name** and select **Create**.

You should now see the HelloWorld project in **Solution Explorer**.

## Add a custom command

1. If you select the `.vsixmanifest` manifest file, you can see what options are changeable, such as description, author, and version.

1. Right-click the project (not the solution). On the context menu, select **Add**, and then **New Item**.

1. Select the **Extensibility** section, and then choose **Command**.

1. In the **Name** field at the bottom, enter a filename such as *Command.cs*.

Your new command file is visible in **Solution Explorer**. Under the **Resources** node, you can find other files related to your command. For example, if you wish to modify the image, the PNG file is here.

## Modify the source code

At this point, the command and Button text are autogenerated and not that interesting. You can modify the VSCT file and CS file if you want to make changes.

* The VSCT file is where you can rename your commands, and define where they go in the Visual Studio command system. As you explore the VSCT file, notice comments that explain what each section of the VSCT code controls.

* The CS file is where you can define actions, such as the click handler.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, find the VSCT file for your extension VSPackage. In this case, it's called *HelloWorldPackage.vsct*.

1. Change the `ButtonText` parameter to `Say Hello World!`.

    ```xml
      ...
      <Button guid="guidCommandPackageCmdSet" id="CommandId" priority="0x0100" type="Button">
        <Parent guid="guidCommandPackageCmdSet" id="MyMenuGroup" />
        <Icon guid="guidImages" id="bmpPic1" />
        <Strings>
            <ButtonText>Say Hello World!</ButtonText>
        </Strings>
      </Button>
      ...
    ```

1. Go back to **Solution Explorer** and find the *Command.cs* file. In the `Execute` method, change the string `message` from `string.Format(..)` to `Hello World!`.

    ```csharp
      ...
      private void Execute(object sender, EventArgs e)
      {
        ThreadHelper.ThrowIfNotOnUIThread();
        string message = "Hello World!";
        string title = "Command";

        // Show a message box to prove we were here
        VsShellUtilities.ShowMessageBox(
            this.ServiceProvider,
            message,
            title,
            OLEMSGICON.OLEMSGICON_INFO,
            OLEMSGBUTTON.OLEMSGBUTTON_OK,
            OLEMSGDEFBUTTON.OLEMSGDEFBUTTON_FIRST);
      }
      ...
    ```

Make sure to save your changes to each file.

## Run it

You can now run the source code in the Visual Studio Experimental Instance.

Step 1. Press **F5** to run the **Start Debugging** command. This command builds your project and starts the debugger, launching a new instance of Visual Studio called the **Experimental Instance**.

Step 2. On the **Tools** menu of the **Experimental Instance**, click **Say Hello World!**.

You should see the output from your new custom command, in this case, the dialog in the center of the screen that gives you the **Hello World!** message.
