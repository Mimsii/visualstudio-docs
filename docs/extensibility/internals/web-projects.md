# Web Projects

A Web project system is a project system that creates Web projects. Web projects in turn create Web applications. You can program a Web page using traditional programming languages, such as Visual Basic or Visual C#, to collect and process information from a user, store it in a database, and so on. Web pages with associated code are called smart Web pages.
