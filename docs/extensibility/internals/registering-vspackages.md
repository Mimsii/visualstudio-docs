# Registering VSPackages

Visual Studio relies on .pkgdef files to describe and locate a VSPackage. A .pkgdef file contains all the registration information that would otherwise be added to the system registry. Managed VSPackages are registered by adding attributes to the source code and then running the [CreatePkgDef Utility](../../extensibility/internals/createpkgdef-utility.md) on the resulting assembly to generate a .pkgdef file.

## In This Section
- [Specifying VSPackage File Location to the VS Shell](../../extensibility/internals/specifying-vspackage-file-location-to-the-vs-shell.md)

 Describes the loading path for VSPackages.

- [Registering and Unregistering VSPackages](../../extensibility/registering-and-unregistering-vspackages.md)

 Explains how to register a VSPackage.
