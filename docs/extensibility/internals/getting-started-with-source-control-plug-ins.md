# Get started with source control plug-ins

To create a source control plug-in, you must create a DLL that implements the functions defined in the Source Control Plug-in API, and then to register the DLL with Visual Studio to make it available for use in source code version control.

 Three versions of the Source Control Plug-in API (versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) are available for source control plug-ins. The Source Control Plug-in API documented here is version 1.3. It was designed to be fully compatible with source control plug-ins supporting versions 1.1 and 1.2. The [What's new in the Source Control Plug-in API Version 1.3](../../extensibility/internals/what-s-new-in-the-source-control-plug-in-api-version-1-3.md) section details the new features supported in the latest version of the Source Control Plug-in API.
