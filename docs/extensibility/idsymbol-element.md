# IDSymbol element

The `IDSymbol` element contains the ID of the GUID:ID pair that represents a menu, group, or command. The GUID comes from the parent `GuidSymbol` element. The `IDSymbol` element has a `name` attribute that provides a friendly name for the ID, which is contained in the `value` attribute.

## Syntax

```xml
<IDSymbol name=ElementName value="0x0010" />
```

## Attributes and elements
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

### Attributes

|Attribute|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|name|Required. Name of the ID symbol.|
|value|Required. Numeric ID value of the ID symbol.|

### Child elements
 None.

### Parent elements

|Element|Description|
|-------------|-----------------|
|[GuidSymbol element](../extensibility/guidsymbol-element.md)|Contains the GUID of the GUID:ID pair that represents a menu, group, or command. Groups `IDSymbol` elements.|

## Remarks
 Every `IDSymbol` element in a given `GuidSymbol` element must have a unique `value`. However, `IDSymbol` elements that have identical values can exist in a package as long as they have different parents.
