# Choose Breakpoints Dialog Box

The **Choose Breakpoints** dialog box opens when you try to set a breakpoint from ambiguous input in the **New Breakpoint** dialog box. A common example of ambiguous input is an overloaded function name.

 **Breakpoints**
 Lists possible breakpoints that can be set based on the ambiguous input. You can select one or more breakpoints to set.

 **All**
 Selects all breakpoints listed in the **Breakpoints** box.

 **None**
 Clears all breakpoints listed in the **Breakpoints** box.
