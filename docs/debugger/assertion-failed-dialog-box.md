# Assertion Failed Dialog Box

An assertion statement specifies a condition that you expect to hold true at some particular point in your program. If that condition does not hold true, the assertion fails, execution of your program is interrupted, and this dialog box appears.

|Click|To|
|-----------|--------|
|Retry|Debug the assertion or get help on asserts.|
|Ignore|Ignore the assertion and continue running the program.|
|Abort|Halt execution of the program and end the debugging session.|
