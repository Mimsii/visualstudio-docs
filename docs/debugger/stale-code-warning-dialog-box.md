# Stale Code Warning Dialog Box

This dialog box appears when you have made changes to native code that **Edit and Continue** could not immediately apply. As a result, some native code in the current stack frame is now out of date, that is, stale. For more information, see [Edit and continue (C++)](edit-and-continue-visual-cpp.md).

**Don't show me this dialog again**

If you select this check box, Edit and Continue will apply code changes without asking permission in the future. You can turn this warning on again by going to the **Options** dialog box, opening the **Debugging** Folder, clicking the **Edit and Continue** page, and selecting **Warn about stale code**.
