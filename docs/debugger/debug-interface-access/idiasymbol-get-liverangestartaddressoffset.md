# IDiaSymbol::get_liveRangeStartAddressOffset

Returns the offset part of the starting address of the range in which the local symbol is valid.

## Syntax

```C++
HRESULT get_liveRangeStartAddressOffset (Â 
   DWORD* offset
);
```

#### Parameters
 `offset`

[out] Returns the offset part of the starting address range.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

> [!NOTE]
> A returned error code means that the symbol does not have live range information.

## Remarks
 The address formed by the section and offset is the beginning of the range in which the symbol is valid.

 To get the section part of the address, use [IDiaSymbol::get_liveRangeStartAddressSection](../../debugger/debug-interface-access/idiasymbol-get-liverangestartaddresssection.md).
