## Remarks

The values in this enumeration are returned by a call to the [IDiaSymbol::get_language](../../debugger/debug-interface-access/idiasymbol-get-language.md) method.

> [!NOTE]
> The newer DXC compiler no longer produces PDBs. This API only has valid values on PDBs produced by the older *fxc.exe* compiler.
