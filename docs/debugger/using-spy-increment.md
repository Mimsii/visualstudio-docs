# Using Spy++

You can use Spy++ to perform the following tasks.

To install required components for Spy++, see [Start Spy++](../debugger/how-to-start-spy-increment.md).

## Display Spy++ views

When Spy++ starts, it opens in [Windows view](windows-view.md), a tree view of all windows and controls available on your machine. This root window is captioned **Windows 1**. There are also three other Spy++ views available: [Messages view](messages-view.md), [Processes view](processes-view.md), and [Threads view](threads-view.md). You can display the desired view from the **Spy** menu.

## Refresh the view

Spy++ takes a *snapshot* of the system tables and refreshes a view based on this information. It's important that you periodically refresh your system views. If you have a Spy++ view open and haven't refreshed the view, you don't see those processes, threads, and windows that are later created. Also, you might see items that no longer exist. The **Refresh** command is available for all views except the Messages view.

To refresh the currently active view:

- Select **Refresh** from the **Window** menu, or choose the **Refresh** button in the toolbar.

## Change fonts

You can change the font, font style, and font size for Spy++ windows.

To change font options:

1. From the **View** menu, select **Font**.

2. Choose a font, font style, and font size.

3. Select **OK**.

   Selecting **Save Font As Default** causes all future Spy++ windows to use this font.

## Expand and collapse Spy++ trees

You can expand and collapse the windows, processes, and threads views by using two methods: by selecting the icons in the window or by using the **Tree** menu. The **+** and **-** icons in the tree act as they do in the C++ project window.

The **Tree** menu contains four commands:

|Menu command|Description|
|------------------|-----------------|
|**Expand one level**|Expands the currently selected item to the next level.|
|**Expand branch**|Fully expands the currently selected item.|
|**Expand all**|Fully expands all items in the window.|
|**Collapse**|Fully collapses the currently selected item.|

> [!TIP]
> If you expand a process, you see all the threads the process owns. If you expand a thread, you see a list of all the windows it owns.

To expand or collapse Spy++ trees:

1. Highlight one of the items in the windows, processes, or threads view.

2. From the **Tree** menu, choose one of the expand or collapse commands.
