# Microsoft Office is not installed on the computer

  Visual Studio can't find the Microsoft Office application that corresponds to the project type. If you're developing a VSTO Add-in project, it means that you can't debug or run the project. If you're trying to create a document-level project, this message means that you can't create the project.

## To correct the error

1. Install the Microsoft Office application associated with the project type, including the primary interop assemblies. For more information about supported versions of Microsoft Office, see [Configure a computer to develop Office solutions](../vsto/how-to-configure-a-computer-to-develop-office-solutions.md).
