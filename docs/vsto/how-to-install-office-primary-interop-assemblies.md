# Install Office primary interop assemblies

  Install the Microsoft Office primary interop assemblies (PIAs) when you install Office.

[!include[Add-ins note](includes/addinsnote.md)]

## Prerequisite

Ensure that you have a version of the .NET Framework that is no older than 2.0.

## To install the PIAs when you install Office

Install Microsoft Office.

> [!WARNING]
> By default, PIA's are embedded in your solution when you build it so you don't have to distribute PIAs to users as a prerequisite to using your VSTO Add-in or customization.
