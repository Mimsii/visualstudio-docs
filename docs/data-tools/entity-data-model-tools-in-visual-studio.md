# Entity Framework Tools in Visual Studio

Entity Framework is an object-relational mapping (ORM) technology that enables .NET developers to work with relational data by using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write. Entity Framework is the recommended object-relational mapping (ORM) modeling technology for new .NET applications.

Entity Framework Tools are designed to help you build Entity Framework (EF) applications. The complete documentation for Entity Framework is here: [Overview - EF 6](/ef/ef6/).

  > [!NOTE]
  > The Entity Framework Tools described on this page are used to generate `.edmx` files, which are not supported in EF Core. To generate an EF Core model from an existing database, see [Reverse Engineering - EF Core](/ef/core/managing-schemas/scaffolding). For more information on the differences between EF 6 and EF Core, see [Compare EF 6 and EF Core](/ef/efcore-and-ef6/).

With Entity Framework Tools, you can create a *conceptual model* from an existing database and then graphically visualize and edit your conceptual model. Or, you can graphically create a conceptual model first, and then generate a database that supports your model. In either case, you can automatically update your model when the underlying database changes and automatically generate object-layer code for your application. Database generation and object-layer code generation are customizable.

The Entity Framework tools are installed as part of the **Data storage and processing** workload in the Visual Studio Installer. You can also install them as an individual component under the **SDKs, libraries, and frameworks** category.

These are the specific tools that make up Entity Framework tools in Visual Studio:

- You can use the ADO.NET **Entity Data Model Designer** (**Entity Designer**) to visually create and modify entities, associations, mappings, and inheritance relationships. The **Entity Designer** also generates C# or Visual Basic object-layer code.

- You can use the **Entity Data Model Wizard** to generate a conceptual model from an existing database and add database connection information to your application.

- You can use the **Create Database Wizard** to create a conceptual model first and then create a database that supports the model.

- You can use the **Update Model Wizard** to update your conceptual model, storage model, and mappings when changes have been made to the underlying database.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Starting with Visual Studio 2010, Entity Framework tools do not support SQL Server 2000.

The tools generate or modify an `.edmx` file. This `.edmx` file contains information that describes the conceptual model, the storage model, and the mappings between them. For more information, see [EDMX](/ef/ef6/).

[Entity Framework 6 Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EntityFrameworkTeam.EntityFrameworkPowerToolsBeta4) help you build applications that use the Entity Data Model. The power tools can generate a conceptual model, validate an existing model, produce source-code files that contain object classes based on the conceptual model, and produce source-code files that contain views that the model generates. For detailed information, see [Pre-Generated Mapping Views](/ef/ef6/fundamentals/performance/pre-generated-views).
