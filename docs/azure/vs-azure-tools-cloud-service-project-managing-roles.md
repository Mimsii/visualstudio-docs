# Manage roles in Azure Cloud Services (extended support)

 [!INCLUDE [Cloud Services](./includes/cloud-services-legacy.md)]

After you have created your Azure Cloud Services (extended support) project, you can add new roles to it or remove existing roles from it. You can also import an existing project and convert it to a role. For example, you can import an ASP.NET web application and designate it as a web role.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio (see [Visual Studio downloads] (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?cid=learn-onpage-download-cta)) with the **Azure development** workload installed, and the Individual Component **.NET Framework project and item templates** installed. See [Modify Visual Studio](../install/modify-visual-studio.md).
