# Deploy prerequisites for 64-bit applications

ClickOnce deployment supports the installation of applications on 64-bit platforms. The target platforms are **x86** for 32-bit platforms, **x64** for machines supporting the AMD64 and EM64T instruction sets, and **Itanium** for the 64-bit Itanium processor.

## Prerequisites
 The following table lists the redistributables that you can use as prerequisites for your 64-bit application's installation.

 If you select a prerequisite that does not have 64-bit components, you may see a warning stating that the selected packages are not available for the 64-bit platform.

| Redistributable | x64 support | IA64 support |
| - |-------------|--------------|
|  Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime  | Yes | No |
| Visual C++ 2010 Runtime Libraries (IA64) | No | Yes |
| Visual C++ 2010 Runtime Libraries (x64) | Yes | No |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (x86 and x64) | Yes | |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile (x86 and x64) | Yes | |
