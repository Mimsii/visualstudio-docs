> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment> class and APIs in the <xref:System.Deployment.Application> namespace are not supported in .NET Core and .NET 5 and later versions. In .NET 7, a new method of accessing application deployment properties is supported. For more information, see [Access ClickOnce deployment properties in .NET](../../deployment/access-clickonce-deployment-properties-dotnet.md). .NET 7 does not support the equivalent of ApplicationDeployment methods.
