# MSB4025

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to load and parse a project, but the project file or MSBuild import file could not be loaded. The file must be an XML MSBuild file, such as a validly formatted project file, `.props` file, or `.targets` file, or a file with any other extension that contains XML that is intended for MSBuild to interpret.

The message resembles the following, but this text might be followed by additional information:

```output
MSB4024: The imported project file could not be loaded.
```

If it's not obvious what imported file caused the problem, rerun the build with full diagnostic logs (use the `-verbosity:diag` command-line switch), and check the MSBuild log file. For bigger output logs on large projects, consider using the binary log (`-bl` command-line switch) and the [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to view the output more easily.

Look to the additional information provided to determine the cause of the problem. Typical causes include the project file is missing, has an incorrect path, or is misspelled; unauthorized access; XML parsing errors in the project file; or it's open and locked by another program.
