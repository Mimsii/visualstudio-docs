## Message text

```output
MSB4016: The build stopped unexpectedly because the 'value' logger failed unexpectedly during initialization.
```

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSB4016: "}UE: This message is used for a special exception that is thrown when a logger fails while initializing itself (most
    likely because of a programming error in the logger). When a logger dies, we cannot proceed with the build, and we throw a
    special exception to abort the build.
