# MSBuild error MSB8059

> MSB8059: `-fsanitize=address` (Enable Address Sanitizer) is incompatible with option '*option-value*'.

This error occurs when you use an option that's incompatible with [`/fsanitize=address`](/cpp/build/reference/fsanitize).

These options and features are incompatible with **`/fsanitize=address`** and should be disabled or avoided:

- The [`/RTC`](/cpp/build/reference/rtc-run-time-error-checks) options are incompatible with AddressSanitizer and should be disabled.
- [`/incremental` (Incremental linking)](/cpp/build/reference/incremental-link-incrementally) is unsupported, and should be disabled.
- [Edit-and-Continue](/visualstudio/debugger/edit-and-continue-visual-cpp) is unsupported, and should be disabled.
- [Coroutines](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/category/coroutine/) are incompatible with AddressSanitizer, and resumable functions are exempt from instrumentation.
- [`/openmp` (OpenMP support)](/cpp/build/reference/openmp-enable-openmp-2-0-support) is unsupported, and should be disabled.
- [`/clr` (Managed C++)](/cpp/build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation) is unsupported, and should be disabled.
- [C++ AMP](/cpp/parallel/amp/cpp-amp-overview) is unsupported, and should be disabled.
- [Universal Windows Platform](/cpp/cppcx/universal-windows-apps-cpp) (UWP) applications are unsupported.
- [Special case list](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerSpecialCaseList.html) files are unsupported.

To resolve this issue, remove the incompatible options from the build instructions for the instrumented code.
