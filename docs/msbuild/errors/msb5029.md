{StrBegin="MSB5029: "}UE: This is a generic message that is displayed when we find a project element that has a drive enumerating wildcard value for one of its
      attributes e.g. <Compile Include="$(NotAlwaysDefined)\**\*.cs"> -- if the property is undefined, the value of Include should not result in enumerating all files on drive.
