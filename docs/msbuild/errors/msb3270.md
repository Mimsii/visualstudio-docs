# MSB3270: There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being built 'arch' and the processor architecture of the reference 'reference', 'arch'

The complete message is similar to the following text:

```output
MSB3270: There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being built 'architecture' and the processor architecture of the reference 'dependency', 'architecture'. This mismatch may cause runtime failures. Please consider changing the targeted processor architecture of your project through the Configuration Manager so as to align the processor architectures between your project and references, or take a dependency on references with a processor architecture that matches the targeted processor architecture of your project.
```

## Possible causes

The message says that you're trying to use a dependency that is of an architecture that doesn't match the target architecture your project is configured for. You first need to confirm your target architectures are correct, and then make sure that all dependencies that are referenced match that target architecture. 

In MSBuild, the `PlatformTarget` property is used to define the target platform.

Setting the MSBuild property `ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch` to None or Warning in the project file suppresses this warning:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
   <!-- other property settings -->
   <ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch>None</ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch>
</PropertyGroup>
```

In Visual Studio, the current platform is set in the menu bar in the IDE, to the right of the **Configuration** dropdown and to the left of the green **Start** button. The current target platform is usually set at the solution level to control the builds for every project. If you need to view or change the platforms for the solution, see [Configure projects to target platforms](../../ide/how-to-configure-projects-to-target-platforms.md).

The platform for an individual project can also be viewed and configured in the **Project Properties**. You can right-click on the project node, choose **Properties**, or press **Alt**+**Enter** to open the project properties editor. For C# projects, expand the **Build** tab, and find the **Platform target** setting. For .NET Framework and all Visual Basic projects, choose the **Compile** tab and find **Target CPU**.
