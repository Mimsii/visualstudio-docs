<!--
{StrBegin="MSB4015: "}UE: This message is used for a special exception that is thrown when a logger fails while shutting down (most likely
    because of a programming error in the logger). When a logger dies, we cannot proceed with the build, and we throw a special
    exception to abort the build.
