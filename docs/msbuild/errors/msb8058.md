# MSBuild error MSB8058

> MSB8058: `-fsanitize=address` (Enable Address Sanitizer) not supported by platform '*platform-name*'

This error occurs when you use a platform target that's incompatible with [`/fsanitize=address`](/cpp/build/reference/fsanitize). Current support is limited to x86 and x64 on Windows 10 or later.

To resolve this issue, remove the incompatible platform targets from the build instructions for the instrumented code.
